Paying the girl off, Hex buys drinks for the entire saloon, getting Lorraine's attention and joining her upstairs. However, Hex manages to avoid her shot and knocks her out, then proceeds to kill her henchmen. Stepping out of the room, he is shot at by the bartender, whom he kills. He then demands that Lorraine tell him where Red is.\nLorraine takes him to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole that leads to a caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is revealed that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells Hex he can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles as she stares at the dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark."}
