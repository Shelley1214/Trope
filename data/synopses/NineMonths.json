{"mid": "NineMonths", "IMDB_id": "tt0113986", "title": "Nine Months", "plot": "Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner has an ideal romance with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. Rebecca is thinking about marriage and children. Samuel is against the idea of marriage as he is happy with how things are between them. This all changes when Rebecca declares she is pregnant and when questioned by Samuel about her birth control she replies birth control is only 97% of the time effective. Samuel's fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their unruly children, as well as the confusing advice he gets from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend. They meet Doctor Kosevich who happens to be Russian. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling neglected, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail. Samuel tries to contact her but she does not respond. When a girl makes a move on Samuel, he declines, saying he's not ready to move on yet. When he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his Porsche 911, buys a family van, and gets back together with Rebecca. They then marry and have their baby together."}
