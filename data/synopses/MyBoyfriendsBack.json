Dingle intends to foil the robbery and save McCloud. The plan backfires, and Dingle is shot. As he lies dying in the store, he asks her to the prom, and McCloud agrees. After his funeral, Dingle inexplicably returns as a zombie and attempts to reintegrate into society. Though he faces anti-zombie discrimination, Dingle is allowed back in school, where he eats a bully. McCloud, though reluctant to follow through with her promise, eventually agrees to attend the prom with Dingle. As McCloud slowly falls for him, Dingle wrestles with his urge to cannibalize McCloud. Dingle eventually overcomes his urges and takes McCloud to the prom, where he finally decays to point of destruction. As he goes to heaven, Dingle learns that a mishap in heaven was the cause for his return as a zombie. Because he was never meant to die, he is sent back to Earth and given a second chance at life. Dingle again sacrifices himself for McCloud during the robbery, but his life is spared when the bullet is deflected by a locket he bought as gift for McCloud. McCloud, overcome by his sacrifice and the gift of the locket, agrees to attend the prom with him."}
