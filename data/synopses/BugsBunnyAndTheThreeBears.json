{"mid": "BugsBunnyAndTheThreeBears", "IMDB_id": "tt0036680", "title": "Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears", "plot": "The Three Bears are hungry and want something to eat, and plan on luring Goldilocks to them with porridge. They find, however, that all they have is carrots, so they make carrot soup instead. The family then pretends to go on a walk through the woods, but quickly comes back to hide in the house and wait for Goldilocks to arrive. The aroma of the carrot soup literally brings Bugs Bunny out of his rabbit hole and into the Bears' home. A plot derived from that of the traditional Goldilocks and the Three Bears story unfolds, with Bugs Bunny as the unwitting guest in the home of the three bears.\nBugs Bunny eats the Bears' soup and goes to sleep in Junior's bed. The Bears attack Bugs, but he manages to escape and is seen standing next to Papa Bear's bed watching the Bears' fight. When Mama Bear approaches him with her fists raised, Bugs flatters her and tells her that she's beautiful, giving her a kiss before he flees. Mama Bear stops Papa Bear and Junior from chasing Bugs, and becomes amorous towards the rabbit, asking him to \"Tell me more about my eyes!\"\nBugs tries to ward off Mama Bear and attempts to flee the house, opening three doors that reveal Mama Bear in three different seductive poses (in a see-through nightgown, talking on the phone, then in a dress & blonde wig, smoking a cigarette, then in a bathtub). Bugs finally crashes through a wall and runs back into his hole. But Mama Bear (unseen) is in the hole and gives Bugs numerous kisses. Bugs comes up out of his hole with his face covered in lipstick kisses and runs away screaming, while Mama Bear also comes up, looking pleased with her make-out session."}
