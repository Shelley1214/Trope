Seeking revenge, Charlie locates the jockey in an upmarket city hotel.\nAt the same hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three drug dealers and collect a guitar case containing cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van to escape from the jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.\nMeanwhile, Guddu's lover Sweety, sister of the politician Sunil Bhope, reveals that she is pregnant with Guddu's child and expresses her wish to marry Guddu. They marry later that night. Bhope hears about his sister's actions and sends his men to apprehend the lovers.

When Charlie returns to retrieve the case, Bhope and his men are waiting inside the van.

An inebriated Mikhail interrupts their conversation and is killed by Bhope.\nOn the way to the airport, Guddu realises that Sweety has faked her stutter. At a petrol station, Lobo and Lele notice the pair. Mistaking Guddu for Charlie, they arrest him.

The policemen take Guddu and Sweety to Bhope's house, where Bhope reveals that a local builder will pay him \u20b950 million (US$780,000) to marry Sweety to the builder's son.
