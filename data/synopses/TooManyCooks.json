They visit the site of their future home while it is only the foundation. The happiness of the new foundation soon dissolves as Albert and Alice start to argue about the floor plan. This problem is made worse when dozens of Alice\u2019s family members come to help, each offering different opinions for the new house.\nAlbert\u2019s bachelor uncle/employer George (Robert McWade) comes to inspect the house. He offers to pay for it, in exchange for living with the newlywed couple on its completion. Alice\u2019s family vehemently opposes, causing the offended George to fire Albert. Due to his unemployment, Alice calls off the engagement.\nTime passes, and the unemployed and single Albert completes the house himself and decides to sell it. Alice returns to see the now completed house and she and Albert reconcile. A now happily married George returns and rehires Albert, and buys the house, only to give it to the new couple as a wedding gift."}
