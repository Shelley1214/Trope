{"mid": "KittyKornered", "IMDB_id": "tt0038671", "title": "Kitty Kornered", "plot": "The neighborhood's cat owners all (literally) throw their cats out for the night. Porky Pig attempts to do the same, but his four cats (a tall black and white lisping cat (Sylvester), a medium-sized tabby, a diminutive kitten, and a dumb drunkard cat) attempt to turn the tables and throw him out into the snow. Porky states that he's starting to hate pussycats. Porky bangs on the door, demanding to be let in, but the cats pop out of the door and proclaim in unison, \"Milkman, keep those bottles quiet!\", and then slam the door in his face which soon leads to a battle between Porky and his cats for the house.\nWhile the cats are lounging around, Porky bursts through the window, making an incredibly menacing face. He chases them around the house until one of them throws him into a cabinet full of dishes and a teapot. Porky retaliates by setting his pet dog \"Lassie\" on the cats. The cats see the dog's shadow and run for their lives, not knowing that \"Lassie\" is really only a shadow puppet created with Porky's fingers and he doesn't actually have a dog.\nWhen the cat with the lisp (\"Sylvester\") finds out that they've been tricked, he and the others plot revenge, which is exacted by having the cats create a War of the Worlds-esque sensation about invading aliens, and driving him into a panic over \"Men from Mars!\". Porky gets frightened and tries to shoot them with a gun but the cats charge at Porky with swords and run him out of the house once and for all and winning the battle. Homeless, alone, and cold in the snow, Porky turns to the camera and asks the audience if they have a vacancy for a house."}
