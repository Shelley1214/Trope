{"mid": "TheSmilingLieutenant", "IMDB_id": "tt0022074", "title": "The Smiling Lieutenant", "plot": "In Vienna, Lieutenant Nikolaus \"Niki\" von Preyn (Maurice Chevalier) meets Franzi (Claudette Colbert), the leader of an all-female-orchestra. They soon fall in love with each other. While standing in formation before a parade honoring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki takes the opportunity to wink at Franzi in the crowd. Unfortunately the gesture is intercepted by Anna, the Princess of Flausenthurm (Miriam Hopkins). The naive Princess assumes offense, leading the lieutenant to convince her that he slighted her because she is thought to be very beautiful. Besotted, the Princess demands she has to marry the lieutenant, or, she'll marry an American instead. The international incident is narrowly averted by having them get married.\nThe Lieutenant sneaks away from his bride to wander the streets of Flausenthurm to find his girlfriend. The princess learns of this and decides to confront Franzi. After the initial confrontation, Franzi sees that the princess is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant, and decides to save the marriage by giving the princess a makeover, singing \"Jazz up your lingerie!\"\nThe results are a complete success as the Lieutenant follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing bride into the bedroom and closes the door \u2013 only to open it and give the audience a last song and a suggestive wink."}
