{"mid": "MyBrilliantCareer", "IMDB_id": "tt0079596", "title": "My Brilliant Career", "plot": "Sybylla (Judy Davis), a headstrong, free-spirited girl growing up in late 19th century Australia, dreams of a better life to the detriment of her work on a country farm. Her parents, upset by her dreams of grandeur, send her to board with her grandmother in hopes of teaching her proper manners and behaviour. She is soon courted by two local men, jackaroo Frank Hawdon (Robert Grubb), whom she ignores, and well-to-do childhood friend Harry Beecham (Sam Neill), whom she grows increasingly fond of.\nSybylla is sent to spend time at the Beecham estate, and her feelings increase toward Harry. She returns to her grandmother's home when Harry is sent on a tour of their properties, with everyone on both estates coyly approving of their romance. Frank attempts to derail the couple through rumours, which leads to increasing tensions between the two. The two take turns attempting to make the other jealous at a ball, leading to Harry's surprise proposal. Sybylla gruffly rejects him, to everyone's surprise. Harry later reveals his rush was to protect Sybylla from his potential financial collapse. Sybylla counters by asking Harry to wait while she discovers herself, and asks him to delay his proposal for perhaps two years.\nSybylla is summoned by her grandmother, and is told she must take a job as governess/housekeeper to the family of an illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. Working in squalor, she manages to teach the children to read using the newspapers wallpapering their home. To her delight, she is sent home when the parents become convinced (incorrectly) that she is wooing their eldest son. Harry visits and proposes again, but she again rejects him, stating her intent is to become a writer.\nThe movie ends with her reading (in voiceover) from her novel, My Brilliant Career, before sending it off for publication."}
