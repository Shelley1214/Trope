He explains to the audience that because of our curiousness, we have become part of his evil experiment. His experiment involves his captive Mike Nelson (himself) being forced to watch terrible and awful movies released in the past few decades. In this film, Dr. Forrester explains that we are to endure the 1955 Universal sci-fi film \"This Island Earth\".On the Satellite of Love, Mike Nelson is doing his morning workout and is greeted by the feminine robot Gypsy (Jim Mallon) and Tom Servo. After hearing a suspicious banging noise, Mike and Tom discover that the wise-cracking Crow T. Robot is attempting to tunnel his way down to Earth with a pickaxe, breaking the hull of the satellite. After fixing the hull by placing a bowl on the hole, Dr. Forrester calls Mike and explains what his experiment is. He also mentions that he hasn't bowed down to him in the past few weeks. Therefore, using a questionable force, he makes MIke and the robots bow down to him. He then proceeds to start the experiment after asking them if they needed to use the restroom. He pulls the lever, the movie sign alarm sounds off, and Mike and the robots proceed to the theater to endure the cheesiness of the 1955 film \"This Island Earth\"."}
