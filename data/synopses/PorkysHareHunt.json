{"mid": "PorkysHareHunt", "IMDB_id": "tt0030608", "title": "Porky's Hare Hunt", "plot": "Several rabbits are eating carrots and ruining crops. Another rabbit warns them to evacuate by saying \"Jiggers, fellers!\". Soon, Porky and his dog meet this rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long, long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won the battle. However Porky finds the rabbit and he doesn't have any brainstorms to protect him. The rabbit shows Porky a photo of himself and of how many children he has with his wife. However, when Porky's about to shoot him, the gun fails.\nAfter Porky attempts to shoot down and procure the rabbit, he asks Porky: \"Do you have a hunting license?\" As Porky reaches for his pocket to obtain the document, the hyper-hare suddenly snatches it out of Porky's grasp, rips it in two, remarks, \"Well you haven't got one now!\" and makes a getaway by twisting his ears as though they were a helicopter propeller, flying away. But Porky suddenly throws a rock at the hovering hare which sends him crashing into a haystack. He emerges from the stack, appearing injured, but fakes it and then goes marching like one of the spirits of '76. Ultimately the rabbit wins when Porky throws dynamite into the cave in which the rabbit is hiding and he throws the dynamite back at him. Later, Porky is in the hospital and the rabbit comes to him with some flowers. Porky tells the rabbit that he'll be out in a few days. \"That's what YOU think!\", the rabbit declares, then pulls on the anvil in Porky's bed, adding to his injuries and runs off into the forest laughing in the sound of Woody Woodpecker."}
