{"mid": "BloodAndDonuts", "IMDB_id": "tt0112527", "title": "Blood & Donuts", "plot": "Boya Zsekely [Gordon Currie] is a vampire. He can live forever...if he chooses.\nSometimes he chooses to sleep for awhile. Last time he went to bed was in\n1969, when Neil Armstrong destroyed the romanticism of the moon by walking\non it. Boya stuffed his personal effects into a suitcase, buried it in a\ncemetery, then wrapped himself up in a burlap bag and went to sleep in the\nceiling of an abandoned building in Toronto. Twenty-five years later, an\nerrant golf ball wakes him up.Molly [Helene Clarkson] works the night shift at Bernie's 24-hour donutshop. Their\nphilosophy is \"Any jerk deserves a well-made donut and a safe place to eat\nit.\" Anyone, that is, except for Earl [Justin Louis], whose problems are like bacteria.\nBreathe on them, and they multiply. Yet, when two neighborhood thugs,\nPierce [Frank Moore] and Axel [Hadley Kay], come into Bernie's looking for Earl, Molly takes out her\nbaseball bat, and Bernie sends them packing. Earl's not there anyway. He's\nout riding taxi. He just dropped off Boya Zsekely at the cemetery,\ncommenting that the guy looked more like a customer than a visitor. [Okay,\nso ask yourself how you'd feel/look waking up from a 25-year sleep.]\nLugging his suitcase, Boya rents a room at the Insmore Hotel, finds a rat\nfor dinner, and then goes down the street to Bernie's to ask where he can\nget some fresh liver. Molly directs him to an all-night grocery store, but\nhe buys a kiwi donut instead and sits down in a booth.In the meantime, Pierce and Axel have found Earl and pressed him into\ndoing a little service for them. They're going to collect 'rent', and they\nneed someone to drive them there and back. When Earl hears a gunshot,\nhowever, he hightails it out of there. While Earl sits at a red light,\nrehearsing his excuse for driving off, a middle-aged lady hops in the back\nseat and asks to be taken to the cemetery. Must be the tourist season.\nRita [ Fiona Reid] goes to the spot where Boya had buried his suitcase, sees\nthat it's been dug up, and knows that Boya's back.\nEarl returns to the donutshop to have a cruller (\"They're not ready\nyet\")...ok, a glazed...when Pierce and Axel come in. They take Earl\noutside and start beating him up. Just as they're squeezing lemon juice\ninto Earl's wounds, Boya joins them. He tosses Axel against a fence, then\nscratches his neck and licks off the blood. Pierce and Axel leave, and\nEarl and Boya go back inside the donutshop. After Earl tells Boya about\nall his problems, Boya offers to let him bed down in his room. After all,\nBoya doesn't need a lot of room...he sleeps in the closet.Boya and Molly have been eyeing each other all night. When Molly is\nscared by a rat, Boya stalks it [in a crawl that's every bit as creepy as\nDracula crawling like a lizard headfirst down the wall of the castle],\ndrinks its blood, and tosses it in the garbage, leaving just a hint of\nblood on his lower lip. \"I worked as an exterminator once,\" he explains to\nMolly. When Molly's shift is over, Boya walks her home, then he goes home\nand takes a bath while she sleeps fitfully in a scene that is probably the\nmost erotic as I've seen in years, and the two of them aren't even in the\nsame house! The next night, Boya goes back to the donutshop. While sitting at the\ncounter, he looks up Rita's address in the phone book. Molly notices and\nasks if it's an old flame. It is, but it's a flame that burned 25 years\nago. \"Just reminiscing,\" Boya explains. \"Each time you turn your back, a\nfew more gone. Makes you want to withdraw.\" Molly understands, but \"You\ncan't go through life afraid to connect because the thing might end,\nright?\" Boya replies simply, \"Not 'might'.\"Pierce and Axel, under orders from the crime boss to teach Boya a\nthing or two, come into the shop with a baseball bat, intending to rough\nhim up. When Axel swings the bat, Boya grabs it and breaks it in two. Then\nBoya's face suddenly metamorphs into a monster with red eyes and long\nteeth. It does the trick, and the boys go running. \"I worked in the circus\nonce,\" he explains to Molly.\nAfter Molly's shift ends, Boya walks her home again. This time he\nkisses her, just as Rita is passing by in a taxi. She confronts Boya in a\njealous girlfriend scene from which Glenn Close could take a few lessons.\nRita is now in her fifties. Her skin is starting to sag, and she's no\nlonger the beauty she was when she and Boya were together. She's spent the\nlast 25 years stewing over what might have been hers if Boya hadn't\ndisappeared and begs him to take her now. He refuses, so she runs a stake\nthrough his chest from behind. He pulls it out, says, \"Don't believe\neverything you hear,\" and goes home to take a bath.Earl, as brainless as he comes across, has figured out that Boya is a\nvampire. When he sees Boya in the bathtub with a hole through his chest,\nhe offers to take him to the hospital, but Boya says that he heals fast.\nWhen Earl asks why Boya hasn't drunk from him, Boya explains that blood-drinking\nfrom humans is, for him, like donut-eating for humans. \"You don't have to\nsubmit.\" Although Earl and Boya have become friends and seem to really care\nabout each other, Earl figures that it's best to move out. Rita drops by\nand finds Boya sleeping in the closet (\"You're really not a day person,\nare you?\"), and begs him again to give her the gift. If he had done it 25\nyears ago, she could have kept her beauty and had all the time in the\nworld. Boya still refuses, so she pulls out a gun and puts it to her head.\nBoya stops her from killing herself, but the bullet does graze her temple.Boya has to get out of there even though it's daytime. He races\nacross the street to the donutshop as his body starts to steam in the\nsunlight. By the time he reaches the door, he is crawling on the ground\nand his skin is charring. He manages to reach up, open the door, and crawl\ninside. Molly rushes to help him. Molly has figured it out, too. She cuts\nher own palm and lets him feed from her. He feeds and feeds until Molly\nhas to pull herself away. \"I thought I could control it,\" Boya moans and\nthen passes out. Molly sits beside Boya while he sleeps on the donutshop\nfloor until sundown, when he wakes up and walks out wordlessly.Meanwhile, Pierce, Axel, and the crime boss have captured Earl and\nare about to cut out his tongue. Somehow, Boya can sense this. He leaps\nonto the fire escape and enters the room through an open window. As Boya\ndrains the crime boss of his blood, Earl backs out the window onto the\nfire escape and falls off, landing on his back on the pavement below. Hurt\nbadly, Earl crawls into his taxi as the thugs take shots at him. Boya\ntumbles through an open window into the taxi and helps Earl drive away.\nBut Earl is in a bad way. Boya stops the car and helps Earl onto the\nground. \"I'm not afraid to die,\" Earl says, and dies.\nJust then, Molly drives up in Bernie's car. Not knowing how Earl died\nor how long ago, she rigs up a makeshift cardiac defibrillator out of a\nscrewdriver and jumper cables. After being zapped several times, Earl\nbegins to breathe again. Boya carries Earl to her car and, since the sun\nis rising, Molly tells Boya to get into the trunk. As the trunk closes,\nMolly drives off. Only after she gets back to the donutshop and opens the\ntrunk does she find that Boya did not get in.\nAt that very moment, as the sun is rising, Boya is lying on top of\nEarl's taxi, allowing himself to die.
