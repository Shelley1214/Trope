{"mid": "Amarcord", "IMDB_id": "tt0071129", "title": "Amarcord", "plot": "A young woman hanging clothes on a line happily points out the arrival of \"manine\" or puffballs floating on the wind. The old man pottering beside her replies, \"When puffballs come, cold winter\u2019s done.\" In the village square, schoolboys jump around trying to pluck puffballs out of the air. Giudizio (Aristide Caporale), the town idiot, looks into the camera and recites a poem to spring and the swirling, drifting \"manine.\"\nAt the hairdresser\u2019s, a Fascist has just had his head newly shaved when Fiorella arrives to accompany her sister Gradisca (Magali No\u00ebl), the village beauty, to the traditional bonfire celebrating spring. As night falls, the inhabitants of Borgo make their way to the village square where Fellini presents his comic characters: the blind accordion player (Domenica Pertica) relentlessly tormented by schoolboys; Volpina (Josiane Tanzilli), the stringy blond nymphomaniac; the stout and buxom tobacconist (Maria Antonietta Beluzzi); Titta (Bruno Zanin), the rosy-cheeked adolescent protagonist based on Fellini's childhood friend; and Aurelio (Armando Brancia), Titta\u2019s father, a construction foreman of working-class background. Modest and reserved, Aurelio responds in frenzied anger to Titta\u2019s pranks while Miranda (Pupella Maggio), his wife, always comes to her son\u2019s defence. Miranda\u2019s brother, Lallo (Nando Orfei), lives with Titta\u2019s family, sponging off his brother-in-law. In tow are Titta\u2019s grandfather (Peppino Ianigro), a likeable old goat with an eye on the family\u2019s young maid, and a street vendor, Biscein (Gennaro Ombra), the town\u2019s inveterate liar.\nGiudizio sits an effigy of the \"Old Witch of Winter\" in a chair on the stack and Gradisca is given the honour of setting it aflame. Lallo maliciously removes the ladder, trapping Giudizio atop the inferno. \"I\u2019m burning!\" he screams as the crowd dances gaily round the bonfire and schoolboys run amuck exploding firecrackers. From a window, the Fascist bigwig (Ferruccio Brembilla) fires his pistol into the air. \"I feel spring all over me already,\" says Gradisca in ecstasy.\nThe local aristocrat and his decrepit wife raise a toast to the dying flames. Schoolboys drag Volpina near the cinders then swing her back and forth in rhythm to the blind accordionist\u2019s tune. A motorcyclist roars through the glowing coals in a mindless display of exhibitionism. Black-clothed women scoop the scattered embers into pans as the town lawyer (Luigi Rossi) appears walking his bicycle. Like Giudizio, he addresses the camera to explain choice tidbits of the town\u2019s history. A florid suite of raspberries interrupts his charming pedantry and he departs in a huff.\nZeus (Franco Magno), the red-haired crusty schoolmaster, presides over an official class photograph. After showing us a wall hung with the portraits of the king, the pope and Mussolini, Fellini serves up a sequence of classroom antics involving Titta, Gigliozzi (Bruno Lenzi), Ovo (Bruno Scagnetti) and Ciccio (Fernando de Felice), the class fat boy who has a crush on Aldina (Donatella Gambini), a lovely brunette. If the schoolboys are stereotypical delinquents, their teachers are ridiculous. During her inane lessons on Giotto\u2019s perspective, the art teacher (Fides Stagni) dips a breakfast biscuit in milk. Expanding her voluptuous chest, the feral-faced maths teacher (Dina Adorni) demonstrates an algebraic formula. Clicking tongue and palate to pronounce a syllable, the Italian teacher (Mario Silvestri) is reduced to hysterics by Ovo\u2019s parody of him. Myopic religion instructor Don Balosa (Gianfilippo Carcano) wipes his glasses and drones on while half the class sneaks out for a smoke in the toilets.\n\"Fu Manchu!\" cries Volpina, prowling on a sunburnt beach. When workers at Aurelio's construction site invite her to join them, the foreman promptly sends her off. Mortar, an old brick-maker, is asked to recite his new poem entitled Bricks:\nMy grandfather made bricks\nMy father made bricks\nI make bricks, too,\nbut where\u2019s my house?\nAurelio replies with a homily on the virtues of hard work. During dinner with his family, Aurelio explodes when news arrives that Titta urinated on the neighbour's hat. The ensuing squabble builds into a delirious domestic fit.\nTitta and his gang follow Gradisca on her promenade under the arcades and, when that proves fruitless, flatten their noses against an irate merchant\u2019s shop window. Lallo and his fellow Don Juans spot a carriage-load of new prostitutes on their way to the local brothel. The news spreads like wildfire to the town's male population.\nThe main concerns of Don Balosa, who doubles as the town priest, are floral arrangements and making sure his schoolboys avoid masturbation. At confession he warns Titta that \"Saint Louis cries when you touch yourself.\" Given his fantasies involving the busty tobacconist, the sensual math teacher, the fat-bottomed peasant women on bicycles, Volpina the man-eater and Gradisca whom he tried to grope at the Cinema Fulgor, Titta complains that it can\u2019t be helped.\nA dirty dust cloud announces the visit of the federale during a parade led by the local gerarca. Following behind him are the maths teacher and her colleagues, rejuvenated by Fascist rhetoric. Now in uniform, Lallo joins the parade shouting \"Mussolini's got balls this big!\" In a wild daydream, Ciccio stands before the giant face of Mussolini, who blesses him and his \"Fascist bride\", Aldina. Surreptitiously wired into the bell tower of the town church, a gramophone plays a recording of the Internationale but it is soon shot at and destroyed by gun-crazy Fascists. Owing to his anarchist past, Aurelio is brought in for questioning and forced to drink castor oil. He limps home in a nauseous state to be washed by Miranda. We discover later that it was Lallo who betrayed him.\nIn a series of fantasy sequences at the Grand Hotel, Gradisca is encouraged to bed the Fascist high official in return for government funds to rebuild the town's harbour while pimple-faced Biscein recounts the night he made love to twenty-eight women in the visiting sultan\u2019s harem. The Grand Hotel also provides the backdrop to Lallo\u2019s gang of mother-controlled layabouts who obsessively pursue middle-aged female tourists.\nOne summer afternoon, the family visits Uncle Teo (Ciccio Ingrassia), Aurelio\u2019s brother, confined to an insane asylum. They take him out for a day in the country but he escapes into a tree yelling, \"Voglio una donna!\" (\"I want a woman!\"). All attempts to bring him down are met with stones that Teo carries in his pockets. A dwarf nun and two orderlies finally arrive on the scene. Marching up the ladder, the nun reprimands Teo who obediently agrees to return to the asylum. \"We are all mad at times,\" sighs Aurelio.\nThe town's inhabitants embark in small boats to meet the passage of the SS Rex, the regime\u2019s proudest technological achievement. By midnight they have fallen asleep waiting for its arrival. Awakened by a foghorn, they watch in awe as the liner sails past, capsizing their boats in its wake. Titta\u2019s grandfather wanders lost in a disorienting fog so thick it seems to smother the house and the autumnal landscape. Walking out to the Grand Hotel, Titta and his friends find it boarded up. Like zombies, they waltz on the terrace with imaginary female partners enveloped in the fog.\nThe annual car race provides the occasion for Titta to daydream of winning the grand prize, Gradisca. One evening the buxom tobacconist is about to close up shop when Titta tries to cadge a cigarette. She ignores him but he catches her interest by boasting that he can lift her. Daring him to try, she\u2019s aroused when he succeeds. Setting her back down, he goes to sit breathlessly in a corner as she draws the shop's iron shutter and exposes a breast, overwhelming Titta by her sheer size. The teenager\u2019s awkward efforts end with him being suffocated by the very objects of his desire. Losing all interest, she sends him away after giving him the cigarette for free.\nOn the cusp of winter, Titta falls sick and is tended by his mother. \"This will go down as the Year of the Big Snow!\" announces the lawyer peering out from behind a snow bank. As Gradisca makes her way to church in the town square, Titta follows in hot pursuit and is almost run over by the motorcyclist bombing through a labyrinth of snow. On a visit to comfort his ailing mother in hospital, she tells him that it\u2019s time he matured. A friendly snow fight breaks out between Lallo, Gradisca, and the schoolboys but is quickly interrupted by a piercing bird call. They watch mesmerized as a peacock, on the rim of a frozen fountain, shows off his magnificent tail.\nTitta wakes to find the house in mourning: Miranda has died. Locking himself in his mother\u2019s bedroom, he breaks down and cries. After the funeral he walks out to the quay just as the puffballs return drifting on the wind. In a deserted field with half the village present, Gradisca celebrates her marriage to a balding pot-bellied officer. A man raises his glass and exclaims, \"She\u2019s found her Gary Cooper!\" Someone asks, \"Where's Titta?\" \"Titta\u2019s gone away!\" cries Ovo, as Gradisca drives off with her carabiniere to the tune of the blind accordion player."}
