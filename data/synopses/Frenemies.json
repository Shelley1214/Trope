{"mid": "Frenemies", "IMDB_id": "tt1865368", "title": "Frenemies", "plot": "The story takes place involving three intertwined stories told by teenage friends who all go to the same school. The first story focuses on how a kid and a dog who are best friends become frenemies and how they become best friends again. The second story focuses on how two BFFs become total frenemies over a senior editor job. The third and final story focuses on two lookalikes who swap lives with each other, similar to The Prince and the Pauper.\n=== Jake and Murray ===\nThe first story focuses on a science whiz teenage boy at Waterbury High School named Jake Logan (Nick Robinson) who is best friends with his dog, Murray (Winston). A popular girl named Julianne (Stefanie Scott) tries to come between them as she tries to get Murray out of her way as Murray sees right through her ruse. Determined to get another \"A\", she hatches a plan to get Murray out of her way for good. She steals Jake\u2019s national prize certificate in molecular astrophysics from NASA, drenches it in her perfume, and drops it through the mail slot in Jake\u2019s front door. Just like Julianne expected, Murray takes Jake\u2019s NASA certificate into the bathroom and attempts to flush it. Jake, who is able to save his certificate, gets angry and yells at Murray to go away. Murray follows his command and runs away from home. A classmate named Savannah O'Neal (Mary Mouser), who loves to skate board and has a crush on Jake, finds Murray and takes him to her house. The next day, Jake starts to worry that Murray might not return, but manages to finish his and Julianne's science project. At school, Jake attempts to dress cool to impress his classmates. But when he discovers Julianne's scheme, Jake refuses to give her the project. Savannah uses this opportunity to expose Julianne\u2019s ruse of using \"people\" to get A\u2019s which results in Julianne being caught. Murray runs in and knocks over Julianne and the science project. Although the project is destroyed, Jake is happy to see Murray and they become best friends again.\n=== Avalon and Halley ===\nThe second story focuses on two female teens, Avalon Greene (Bella Thorne) and Halley Brandon (Zendaya) who created a web magazine called \"GeeklyChic.\" In the school library, Halley gets a call from her and Avalon's favorite New York City publishing company, Burns Publications, run by the stunning Cherie St. Claire (Jessalyn Wanlim). Halley thinks her older brother Kendall (Jascha Washington), who is into men's fashion, is playing a prank on her until she sees him doing a service project right out the window of the library and realizes she really has received a call from Cherie. Cherie invites them to go to the publishing company\u2019s headquarters in the beautiful Manhattan, New York to ask them something that could change their lives. During the talk, Cherie tells Avalon and Halley that she likes their web magazine and offers to buy it, but decides to only let one of them be the senior editor, because she believes that the quality of the writing will be better. Cherie decides to let each of them write a cover article and will judge who wrote the best article as that writer will become the senior editor. At school, Avalon encounters with classmate Walker (Connor Price), who allows her to contact a French singer named Jean Frank. Now, the two girls decide to interview Jean after his first American sold-out concert which leads them to become frenemies. Meanwhile, Jean reveals himself to the girls that he's American and his real name is Johnny Frankewski. At the end, they decide that they will share the article. Cherie becomes angry and decides not to hire either of them, because of their immaturity with the situation. The television show \"Teens Now\" picks up their article about Jean changing his image as he was only posing as a singer from Paris, France. \"Teens Now\" also broadcasts their blog\u2019s website for their audience to check out. Seeing that their web magazine has gone global on their hit counter map, Avalon and Halley make up as best friends again.\n=== Savannah and Emma ===\nThe third and final story of the film focuses on Savannah O\u2019Neal and Emma Reynolds-teenage alter egos (both roles are played by Mary Mouser) who trade places because they each believe the other's life is better. Savannah is a teenage tomboy who loves skateboarding and lives with her dad and three brothers. She has a crush on Jake Logan and attends Waterbury High School with Avalon, Halley, Jake, and Julianne. Emma is a teenage rich girly-girl who goes to a private school. Thinking the other has the better life, they trade places (under the persuasion of Halley and Avalon) when they meet at the mall. They soon discover the other didn't have the glamorous life that they thought the other had. Emma (disguised as Savannah) gets a date with Jake and during the date Emma starts acting romantic, causing Savannah to get mad and say \"That's (meaning Jake) my boyfriend!\" which leads to Emma getting upset when she finds out that Savannah went out with Lance (Dylan Everett) who was Emma's previous boyfriend and the two start fighting and Savannah storms off. Later, at Emma's birthday ball, \"Emma\" (really Savannah) dumps Lance. The real Emma is overjoyed when she hears about this, because she had been trying to get rid of them ever since they started dating; however, she had never gotten the courage to do so. The girls forgive each other and switch lives once more. Avalon and Halley then lead everyone in a lively dance to \"Pose\" (by Stefanie Scott) as the film ends."}
