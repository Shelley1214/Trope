{"mid": "TheCreepingTerror", "IMDB_id": "tt0057970", "title": "The Creeping Terror", "plot": "A newlywed deputy, Martin Gordon (Vic Savage), encounters an alien spacecraft that has crash landed in fictional Angel County in California. A large, hairy, slug-like, omnivorous monster emerges from the side of an impacted spaceship. A second one, still tethered inside, kills a forest ranger and the sheriff (Byrd Holland) when they independently enter the craft to investigate.\nGordon, now a temporary sheriff, joins his wife Brett (Shannon O'Neil). Dr. Bradford (William Thourlby), a renowned scientist, Col. James Caldwell (John Caresio), a military commander, and Caldwell's men were sent to fight the creature. Meanwhile, the monster stalks the countryside, devouring a girl in a bikini, picnickers at a \"hootenanny\", Grandpa Brown (Jack King) and his grandson while fishing, a housewife hanging the laundry, the patrons at a community dance hall, and couples in their cars at a lovers' lane.\nThe protagonists deduce that the monsters are mindless biological-sample eaters. The bio-analysis data is microwaved back to the probe's home planet through the spaceship.\nCaldwell decides that the creatures must be killed, despite Bradford's objections. He orders his men to fire at the creature, which they do while standing close to one another as it moves towards them. Their gunfire proves ineffective, and all of the troops are devoured. Paradoxically, Caldwell decides a moment later to throw a grenade, and the creature dies instantly.\nUltimately, both creatures are destroyed, but not before the signal is sent. The dying Bradford suggests that this bodes ill for the human race, but observes that, since the galaxy to which the transmission was aimed is a million light years away, the threat may not manifest itself for millennia."}
