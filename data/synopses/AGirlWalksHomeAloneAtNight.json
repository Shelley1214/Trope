In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\nThe pimp comes across a strange young woman in a chador at night, and back at his apartment she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with the drugs and cash. Arash dresses up as Dracula, and goes to a night club where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the ecstasy pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.\nAtti, a prostitute who works for the pimp, is followed at night by the woman in the chador, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. They have a conversation during which the woman in the chador realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\nSuffering from heroin withdrawal, Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman with the chador, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body.

As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death.
