{"mid": "VelvetGoldmine", "IMDB_id": "tt0120879", "title": "Velvet Goldmine", "plot": "Set in a dystopian, grey version of 1984, gay British journalist Arthur Stuart is writing an article about the withdrawal from public life of 1970s bisexual glam rock star Brian Slade, and is interviewing those who had a part in the entertainer's career. As each person recalls their thoughts, it becomes the introduction of the vignette for that particular segment in Slade's personal and professional life.\nPart of the story involves Stuart's family's reaction to his sexuality, and how the gay and bisexual glam rock stars and music scene gave him the strength to come out. Rock shows, fashion, and rock journalism all play a role in showing the youth culture of 1970s Britain, as well as the gay culture of the time.\nNear the beginning of his career, Slade is married to Mandy. But when he comes to the United States, he seeks out gay American rock star Curt Wild and they become involved in each other's lives on a personal and creative level.\nThe vignettes show both Wild and Slade becoming increasingly difficult to work with as they become more famous. Wild and Slade, and other main characters, suffer breakdowns in both their personal and professional relationships. Eventually, Slade's career ends following the critical and fan backlash from his on-stage publicity stunt where he faked his own murder.\nAs he gets closer to the truth of where Brian Slade is now, Stuart is told by his publisher that the story is no longer of public interest, and Stuart has now been assigned to the Tommy Stone tour. But Stuart is obsessed and continues searching out Slade. We discover that Stuart was also at the concert where Slade faked his own death, and that after seeing Wild perform, Wild and Stuart had a sexual encounter.\nEventually, Stuart discovers the true identity and whereabouts of Brian Slade, and once again encounters Wild as several mysteries are resolved."}
