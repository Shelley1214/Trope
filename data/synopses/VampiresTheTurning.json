{"mid": "VampiresTheTurning", "IMDB_id": "tt0398378", "title": "Vampires: The Turning", "plot": "Prologue: For many centuries, phi song neng (vampire spirits who have\nvowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the Far\nEast. One day, over 800 years ago, a young, human warlord named Niran fell in\nlove with a beautiful song neng woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his\nown, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked\nNiran during a Songkran []New Year] solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran\nhave come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill humans for\npleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing\nso, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as\nwell as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival\nwill feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself\nby exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and, thus, wipe\nout all the vampires in Thailand.Connor [Colin Egglesfield] and Amanda [Meredith Monroe] are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran\nfestival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes\nAmanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back\nto their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr\nNice Guy [Dom Hetrakul] offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut\ndown a deserted alley, then suddenly turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood\nand carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped\nby another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is\nabout to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's\nhead. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to\nleave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Of\ncourse, Connor steathfully (i.e., ten steps behind) follows Kiko [Roger Yuan] home to Kong\nSai House.When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours have\npassed, Connor goes back to Kong Sai House, only to find everyone asleep. While\nsnooping through the house, Connor is attacked by a female vampire [Stephanie Chao] (who turns\nout to be Sang, but Connor doesn't know that yet). Connor gets away from her by\njumping out a window. As Connor lands on the ground below, he is stopped by vampire slayer Raines [Patrick Bauchau] who insists on testing Connor's blood to see if he\nis infected. When Connor comes up clean, he begs Raines to help him find\nAmanda but, like Kiko, Raines warns him to leave Thailand. Amanda is as good as\ndead, he says. If she resists, the jai tham will bleed her dry; if not, they'll\nturn her, and then Raines will slay her (he gets $10,000 for every vampire he\nkills). Either way, Amanda should be considered dead to Connor.Connor won't accept it and returns again to Kong Sai House. While there,\nhe sees a photo of Niran in front of the Techno Games Arcade near the Phang Nga\nmarket. Figuring that Niran might have taken Amanda there, he snoops around. He\nfinds Amanda being held in a cell with skeletons, carcasses, and other humans\nin various stages of being drained of their blood. Basically, he's stumbled\ninto the jai tham's pantry. Amanda and Connor escape but are attacked outside\nby two jai tham on a motorcycle. One drives off with Amanda; the other stays\nto kill Connor. Just as Niran and the rest of the jai tham arrive to join the\nfun, Sang appears. Connor grabs a motorcycle and, with Sang riding behind him,\nthey succeed in outrunning the jai tham.Both Amanda and Connor are now faced with decisions. Amanda must decide\nwhether to allow Niran to turn her or to keep on drinking from her, which\ncauses acute pain. Connor has to decide whether or not to join the song neng in\nhopes of winning the battle with the jai tham and helping Sang to kill herself\nso that all vampires (including him) will be turned back into mortals. The\nalternative, if Sang is not successful, is that Connor will remain a vampire\nuntil the next Songkran eclipse rolls around in 800 years and Sang can try\nagain. Connor's decision is made doubly hard because he's got the hots for\nSang. Amanda decides to continue resisting, and Connor decides to become song\nneng. This requires being bitten by Sang and, apparently, having sex with her,\ntoo.The day of the eclipse is upon them. The song neng have made a deal with\nthe slayers. Since Sang's embrace of the sun must take place in the same\nspot where the curse began 800 years ago (a couple blocks away), the song neng\nhave made a deal with Raines. Raines and his slayers will line the buildings\nand walls that overlook the site, which looks like an archeological dig, in\norder to kill any jai tham who try to stop Sang. Connor, Kiko, and the rest\nof the song neng will help Sang get to the required spot. The eclipse starts at\n3:00, and they will have 17 minutes to do the job. All is set.Suddenly, the sun is covered and the city falls dark. The slayers are in\nposition. Connor and the song neng move out from under the trees. The jai tham\narrive on their motorcycles. In the melee that follows, Connor and Niran fall\nthrough a weak spot into a pit where they continue fighting. Time is running\nout, and Kiko realizes that the slayers have double-crossed them. Suddenly, the\nslayers open fire, shooting everyone, song neng and jai tham. Only Connor and\nNiran remain protected in their hole. Connor manages to impale Niran, but when\nhe surfaces from the pit, Connor finds only bodies. He shouts for Sang, but\nthere is no answer. Raines walks up, gloating over how much he will get for all\nthe vampire heads AND those in the future. If Sang ends the curse, he explains,\nthere's no more vampires, and we're in the vampire hunting business.Connor locates Sang as Raines turns his crossbow on her. Connor offers to\nshoot Sang so that she doesn't have to suffer. Raines hands his bow to Connor.\nConnor aims at Sang but suddenly swings his aim to Raines. Forcing Raines to\ncarry Sang to the designated spot, Connor gives her one last kiss before the\nsun reappears and Sang is toast. She explodes, taking Raines with her. Connor\nhurries back to the jai tham's pantry and rescues Amanda.Epilog: Connor and Amanda are on an airplane flying back to the States.\nAmanda looks out the window, and her eyes appear to be totally black. Is she or\nisn't she? [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"}
