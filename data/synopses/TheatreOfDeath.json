{"mid": "TheatreOfDeath", "IMDB_id": "tt0062358", "title": "Theatre of Death", "plot": "Horror, murder, mystery and mayhem make up the principal ingredients\nof the Theatre de Morte. New director Phillipe Darvas [Christopher Lee], son of the old\ndirector, vows to dedicate his life to the theatre, as did his father. At\nthe opening night cast party, patroness Mme Angelique [Evelyn Laye] requests that Darvas\ngive a preview of coming attractions, so Darvas asks Dani Gireaux [Lelia Goldoni] and\nnewcomer Nicole Chapelle [Jenny Till] to perform a scene from 'The Witches of Salem'.Darvas first hypnotizes the scared Nicole who then performs so\nrealistically that Dani's boyfriend, Dr. Charles Marquis [Julian Glover], interrupts the\nscene when it looks like Nicole intends to burn Dani's face with the hot\npoker she is brandishing. Charles, a police surgeon recuperating from a\nhand injury, is meanwhile investigating the deaths of 3 women, all stabbed\nin the neck with a sharp item, all drained of blood, a situation known to\npolice as 'hemaphagia', to the public as vampire. Since the instrument\nused seems to resemble knives used in one of the performances at the\nTheatre of Death, Charles suspects that Darvas may be involved.Meanwhile, Darvas takes a liking to Nicole and, thinking he can make\nan actress of her, he begins to probe her life, her motivations, her inner\nsecrets. When Darvas asks Nicole to move into his theatre apartment with\nhim, Dani becomes upset. Her concern is that Nicole is too young and\nvulnerable to get mixed up with Darvas, but Darvas sees it as jealousy and\nfires Dani on grounds that she is mentally unstable, as she recently spent\ntwo years in a mental hospital. When Charles gives Darvas a ride home and\nprobes him about the hemaphagiac murders, Darvas becomes agitated. Is\nDarvas the vampire?The next day, Darvas's cape is found covered with blood, but no body\nis found. The murders stop but Nicole acts as though Darvas is still with\nher. Is Darvas really dead? Is Nicole hiding Darvas somewhere? Charles and\nDani decide to 'babysit' Nicole. They move into the theatre apartment with\nher and follow her everywhere, but she leads them nowhere. Suddenly, the\nmurders start up again--a prostitute on the dock, a young woman coming\nhome from a date. Then Darvas's decomposed body is discovered floating in\na pond. Whatever Darvas might have been, he isn't the hemaphagiac murderer.One evening, Dani, Charles and Nicole have dinner in a Romanian\nrestaurant. Nicole plays her guitar for the patrons, and the restaurant\nowners wife recognizes the tune as Romanian. The names Constantine and\nAnna engraved into Nicole's guitar remind them of a gypsy family with whom\nthey escaped Romania in 1946 by crossing the Italian Alps in February. The\nsmall caravan became entrapped by an avalanche in a little-traveled pass.\nOne of the men killed the horses, and they ate the meat. But Anna's baby\ncould not eat meat, so she killed one of the other children and fed his\nblood to her child. That child's name was Nicole. Could Nicole Chapelle\nand the gypsy baby Nicole be one and the same?Then Dani discovers a script written by Darvas just before his death.\nEntitled 'The Caravan', it tells the tale of a gypsy caravan caught in an\navalanche and of a mother killing one child to feed his blood to her baby.\nDani now knows for sure that the baby is Nicole Chapelle. Yes, Nicole\nkilled those women to satisfy her need for blood. Yes, Nicole killed\nDarvas because he was about to unveil her story. Now Nicole must kill Dani\nto safeguard her secret.Nicole hypnotizes Dani to confess to all the murders, then she forces\nDani to stab herself. But Charles interrupts them in the nick of time.\nNicole escapes, runs to the theatre where she hides under the stage and is\naccidentally speared during the final scene of the show.
