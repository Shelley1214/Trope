{"mid": "LesVampires", "IMDB_id": "tt0006206", "title": "Les vampires", "plot": "=== Episode 1 \u2013 \"The Severed Head\" ===\nPhilipe Gu\u00e9rande (\u00c9douard Math\u00e9), a reporter working for the newspaper \"The Paris Chronicle\" who is investigating a criminal organisation called the Vampires, receives a telegram at work stating that the decapitated body of the national security agent in charge of the Vampire investigations, Inspector Durtal, was found in the swamps near Saint-Clement-Sur-Cher, with the head missing. Being turned down by the local magistrate (Thel\u00e8s), he spends the night in a nearby castle owned by Dr. Nox (Jean Aym\u00e9), an old friend of his father, along with Mrs. Simpson (Rita Herlor), an American multimillionaire who desires the property. After waking up in the night, Philipe finds a note in his pocket saying \"Give up your search, otherwise bad luck awaits you! \u2013 The Vampires\", and discovers a mysterious passage behind a painting in his room. Meanwhile, Mrs. Simpson\u2019s money and jewels are stolen in her sleep by a masked thief, but Philipe is suspected of the crime. Philipe again visits the magistrate, who now believes his case, and they trick Dr. Nox and Mrs. Simpson into waiting in an anteroom. At the castle, Philipe and the magistrate find the head of Inspector Durtal hidden in the passage in Philipe\u2019s room. Back in the anteroom, they find that Mrs. Simpson is dead and that Dr. Nox has vanished. Her pocket contains a note from the Grand Vampire saying that he has murdered the real Dr. Nox and is now assuming his identity.\n=== Episode 2 \u2013 \"The Ring That Kills\" ===\nGrand Vampire in disguise as Count de Noirmoutier, reads that ballerina Marfa Koutiloff (Stacia Napierkowska), who is engaged to Philipe, will perform a ballet called The Vampires. To prevent her from publicizing the Vampires' activities and to deter Philipe, he gives Marfa a poisoned ring before her performance, which kills her onstage. Amidst the panicking crowds Philipe recognizes the Grand Vampire and follows him to an abandoned fort and is captured by the gang. They agree to interrogate Philipe at midnight and execute him at dawn. Philipe finds that the Vampire guarding him is one of his co-workers, Oscar-Cloud Mazamette (Marcel L\u00e9vesque). They decide to work together and capture the Grand Inquisitor when he arrives at midnight. They bind and hood the Grand Inquisitor, and set him up for execution in place of Phillipe. At dawn the Vampires arrive for the execution, but the police raid the lair. The Vampires escape, but as they flee they mistakenly execute their own Grand Inquisitor, who turns out to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n=== Episode 3 \u2013 \"The Red Codebook\" ===\nWhile faking illness to get off work, Philipe tries to decode a red booklet that he lifted from the Grand Inquisitor\u2019s body, which contains the crimes of the Vampires. He discovers that his house is under surveillance by the Vampires, so he leaves in disguise. Following clues in the booklet he arrives at \"The Howling Cat\" night club. Performing there is Irma Vep (Musidora), whose name Philipe sees is an anagram for vampire. After her act, the Grand Vampire assigns Irma to retrieve the red booklet. As Philipe returns home Mazamette arrives, along with a poison pen he stole from the Grand Vampire. A few days later, Irma arrives at their house disguised as a new maid, but Philipe recognizes her. She tries to poison him, but fails. His mother (Delphine Renot) leaves to meet her brother after receiving word that he has been in a car accident, but it turns out to be a trap and she is captured by the Vampires. While Philipe is asleep, Irma lets another Vampire into his home but he shoots them. They escape, however, because his gun was loaded with blanks. In a shack in the slums, Philipe\u2019s mother is held by Father Silence (Louis Leubas), a deaf-mute, and is forced to sign a ransom note, but she kills him with Mazamette\u2019s poison pen and escapes.\n=== Episode 4 \u2013 \"The Spectre\" ===\nThe Grand Vampire, under the alias of a real estate broker \"Treps\", meets Juan-Jos\u00e9 Mor\u00e9no (Fernand Herrmann), a businessman, who asks for an apartment with a safe. The Grand Vampire puts Mor\u00e9no into an apartment whose safe is rigged to be opened from the rear through the party wall of an apartment belonging to Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire. However, the case Mor\u00e9no places inside contains the Vampires\u2019 black attire. Later, in disguise as bank secretary \"Juliette Bertaux\", Irma learns that a man called Mr. Metadier has to bring \u20a3300,000 to another branch. In the event that he is unable to make the delivery, Irma will. Soon afterward, Mr. Metadier is murdered by the Vampires and his body thrown from a train. When Irma is about to take the money for him a spectre of Mr. Metadier appears and takes it instead. The Grand Vampire pursues the spectre, who escapes down a manhole. Later that day, Mme. Metadier appears at the bank, saying she hasn\u2019t seen her husband in days. They also find out that the money hasn\u2019t been delivered. Philipe learns of this and goes to the bank in disguise. Recognizing the secretary as Irma, he finds her address and a few hours later sneaks in, using Mazamette as a ploy. Irma and the Grand Vampire open the safe from their side, only to find Metadier\u2019s body and the money. Philipe tries to capture them but is knocked down and they escape. Philipe calls the police just as Mor\u00e9no enters and finds his safe opened from the other side. He walks through and is caught by Philipe. Mor\u00e9no is revealed to be another criminal in disguise, and claims not to have killed Metadier, but to have found his body by the train tracks where the Vampires had dumped it. Mor\u00e9no found Metadier's letter of authority on his corpse, took Metadier's body home, disguised himself as Metadier, put the body in his safe, assumed Metadier's identity, took the money, and put it too in his safe. The upshot is that the money is now in the Vampires' possession. The police arrive and arrest Mor\u00e9no.\n=== Episode 5 \u2013 \"Dead Man's Escape\" ===\nThe examining magistrate from Saint-Clement-Sur-Cher relocates to Paris and is assigned to the Vampire case and the Mor\u00e9no affair. After being summoned to the magistrate, Mor\u00e9no commits suicide using a concealed cyanide capsule. His body is left in his cell, but during the night he wakes up, very much alive. He kills the night-watchman and takes his clothes, escaping from the prison. He is noticed by Mazamette, who is suffering from insomnia. The following morning, Mor\u00e9no is found to have escaped. While writing an account of the events, Philipe is pulled out of his window by the Vampires and whisked into a large costume box. He is driven away and the box is unloaded, but incompetently, and it slides down a large flight of stairs. The Vampires retreat and Philipe is let out by two bystanders. He visits the costume designer Pugenc whose name and box number (13) are on the costume box, just missing Mor\u00e9no and his gang who have bought police uniforms for a scheme of their own. Philipe learns from Pugenc that the costume box was to go to Baron de Mortesalgues on Maillot Avenue, and realizes that \"Mortesalgues\" must be another alias of the Grand Vampire. Later, Mor\u00e9no confronts Philipe in a caf\u00e9, but when Philipe calls for the nearby policemen, they turn out to be part of Mor\u00e9no\u2019s gang and he is again captured. Meanwhile, Mazamette breaks into Mor\u00e9no's hideout. Philipe is taken there to be hanged by the gang, unless he can give them means to revenge themselves against the Vampires. He tells them that Baron de Mortesalgues is the Grand Vampire, and they spare him, tying him up. Mazamette appears and frees him. That evening, the Grand Vampire, in disguise as Baron de Mortesalgues, holds a party for his \"niece\", who is Irma Vep in disguise. The party attracts many members of the Parisian aristocracy. \"Mortesalgues\" reveals that at midnight there will be a surprise; but the \"surprise\" is a sleeping-gas attack on the guests. The Vampires steal all of the guests' valuables while they are unconscious. The Vampires flee with the stolen items on the top of their car, but Mor\u00e9no, forewarned by Philipe, robs the Vampires and sends Philipe a letter telling him that, for the moment, they are even. Mazamette visits Philipe; he is angry with their lack of progress and wants to quit. Philipe opens a book of La Fontaine's Fables and points to the line, \u201cin all things, one must take the end into account\u201d, and Mazamette's resolve is renewed.\n=== Episode 6 \u2013 \"Hypnotic Eyes\" ===\nFifteen days have passed since the events at Maillot. Mor\u00e9no is looking for clues to lead him to the Vampires, and reads in a paper that a Fontainebleau notary has been murdered by them; as he happens to possess a gaze with a terrible hypnotic power, he takes control of his new maid, Laura, to turn her into his slave. Meanwhile, Philipe and Mazamette happen to see a newsreel on the murder inquest, in which they spot Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire. They cycle to Fontainebleau to investigate. En route they spot an American tourist, Horatio Werner, riding fast into the forest, and follow him. He places a box under one of the boulders, and they take it. The Grand Vampire, who is staying in the Royal Hunt Hotel under the pseudonym of Count Kerlor, along with Irma in disguise as his son, Viscount Guy, reads in a paper that George Baldwin (\u00c9mile Keppens), an American millionaire, has been robbed of $200,000. Whoever can capture the criminal, Raphael Norton, who has fled to Europe with the actress Ethel Florid, will be awarded the unspent balance of the loot. \"Kerlor\" notices that Mr and Mrs. Werner, who are staying at the hotel, are distressed by this notice, and concludes that Mr. Werner is Raphael Norton. Philipe and Mazamette arrive at the hotel and find that the Vampires are based there. In a different hotel they force open the box and find Baldwin\u2019s stolen money inside. Mor\u00e9no comes to the Royal Hunt in disguise. While the Grand Vampire tells the hotel guests a story, Irma breaks into the Werners' suite, finding a map leading to the box in the forest. When she leaves, she is captured and chloroformed by Mor\u00e9no, who takes the map. While his gang take Irma away, he dresses his hypnotized maid, Laura, as Irma and tells her to give the Vampires the map. Once one of the Vampires (Miss \u00c9dith) follows the map to get the treasure, Mor\u00e9no\u2019s gang ambushes her, only to find that Philipe has already taken it. Moreno demands that the Grand Vampire ransom Irma Vep. In the early morning, the police raid the hotel and find that Werner is actually Norton, so Philipe and Mazamette win the money. Mor\u00e9no falls in love with Irma and decides not to return her to the Grand Vampire. Instead, he hypnotizes her and causes her to write a confession of her involvement in the murders of the Fontainbleau notary (in this episode), Metadier (episode 4), the ballerina Marfa Koutiloff (episode 2), and Dr. Nox (episode 1). The Grand Vampire comes to meet Mor\u00e9no, but Mor\u00e9no by hypnotic command compels Irma to kill him. The episode ends with the now-wealthy Mazamette informing a dozen adoring journalists that \"although vice is seldom punished, virtue is always rewarded\".\n=== Episode 7 \u2013 \"Satanas\" ===\nA mysterious man (Louis Leubas) arrives at Mor\u00e9no\u2019s home, and shows that he knows that the Grand Vampire\u2019s body is inside a trunk. Mor\u00e9no tries to get rid of him, but he is paralysed by a pin in the man\u2019s glove. The man reveals himself to be the true Grand Vampire, Satanas, and that the first was a subordinate. While at a cabaret called the \"Happy Shack\", Mor\u00e9no and Irma receive a note from Satanas saying they will see proof of his power at two o'clock. At two he fires a powerful cannon at the \"Happy Shack\", largely destroying it. Meanwhile, Philipe decides to visit Mazamette, but he is out \"chasing the girls.\" He hides as Mazamette arrives home, drunk, with two women and a friend, who he later chases out angrily at gunpoint. The next morning, Irma and Mor\u00e9no go to Satanas\u2019 home to surrender, and Satanas offers them the chance to work with him, informing them that American millionaire George Baldwin is stopping at the Park Hotel. Satanas wants Baldwin's signature. One of Mor\u00e9no\u2019s accomplices, Lily Flower (Suzanne Delv\u00e9), goes to the Park Hotel and poses as an interviewer from \"Modern Woman\" magazine and through trickery gets Baldwin to sign a blank piece of paper. Afterwards, Irma enters and dupes Baldwin into recording his voice saying \"Parisian women are the most charming I've ever seen, all right!\" Lily Flower brings Baldwin's signature to Mor\u00e9no\u2019s home, and Mor\u00e9no writes out an order (over Baldwin's signature) to pay Lily Flower $100,000. Mor\u00e9no\u2019s gang seize the hotel telephone operator of Baldwin's hotel; Irma takes her place by using a forged note. When the bank cashier calls Baldwin to confirm that he has given a very large draft to an attractive Parisian woman, Irma intercepts the call, and plays the recording she made of Baldwin's voice, and the cashier is persuaded. While Lily Flower is taking the money, Mazamette comes in, recognising her as his old squeeze from the \"Happy Shack\", and follows her, seeing her hand the money to a man in a taxi \u2013 Mor\u00e9no! Mor\u00e9no gives Satanas the money, but he is given it back as a present. Philipe and Mazamette capture Lily Flower at her home and make her call Mor\u00e9no and tell him to come, but when he and Irma arrive they fall into a trap and are caught by the police.\n=== Episode 8 \u2013 \"The Thunder Master\" ===\nIrma, sentenced to life imprisonment, has been sent to St. Lazarus\u2019 prison. A transfer order is sent to the prison to send Irma to a penal colony in Algeria. On the day of her departure, Irma finds out that Mor\u00e9no has been executed. Satanas follows Irma\u2019s transportation route, stopping at a seaside hotel in disguise as a priest. At the port, he gives some religious comfort to the prisoners, but Irma\u2019s copy contains a secret message saying \u201cthe ship will blow up\u201d and giving her directions on how to safeguard herself. Satanas destroys the ship with his cannon. Meanwhile, Philipe finds through the red codebook that the explosive shell that landed on the \u201cHappy Shack\u201d came from Montmartre, and Mazamette goes to investigate. His son, Eustache Mazamette (Ren\u00e9 Poyen), is sent home from school for bad behaviour, so they go to \"investigate\" together. They find some men loading boxes into a house, and notice one of the top hat cases contains a shell. Later, reading that no survivors have been found from the exploding ship, Satanas visits Philipe to avenge Irma\u2019s death. Satanas paralyses Phillipe with the poisoned pin in his glove and leaves a bomb in a top hat to kill him off. Mazamette arrives and throws the top hat out the window just in time. At Satanas\u2019 home, Eustache is used as a ploy to hide Mazamette in a box, but Satanas sees this through a spy-hole. Satanas threatens Eustache, but Eustache shoots at Satanas, and the police raid the building and arrest him. After the action, they find that Mazamette\u2019s nose has been broken by Eustache\u2019s shot. Meanwhile, Irma is shown to have survived the blast on the ship, and is on her way back to Paris as a stowaway under a train. She is helped by the station staff and police, pretending that she is in \u201cone of those eternal love stories beloved by popular imagination.\u201d She makes her way to the Vampire hangout, the \u201cHowling Cat\u201d nightclub, where she performs, and is rapturously greeted by the Vampires. Upon hearing of the arrest of Satanas, one of the Vampires, Venomous (Frederik Moriss), appoints himself the new chief. By Satanas\u2019 orders, they mail him an envelope containing a poisoned note, which he eats to commit suicide.\n=== Episode 9 \u2013 \"The Poisoner\" ===\nIrma is now a devoted collaborator of Venomous, who is set on getting rid of Philipe and Mazamette. He learns that Philipe is engaged to Jane Bremontier (Louise Lagrange), and the following day Irma and Lily Flower rent an apartment above hers. Irma\u2019s maid, a Vampire also, hears that Philipe and Jane\u2019s engagement party will be catered for by the famous B\u00e9chamel House. Venomous cancels their catering order, and on the day of the party the Vampires appear instead. Jane\u2019s mother (Jeanne Marie-Laurent) gives the concierges one bottle of the Vampires' champagne as a present, and just as dinner is served the male concierge, Leon Charlet, drinks it, is poisoned and dies. His wife stops the party guests from drinking their champagne just in time, and the Vampires make a hasty escape. A few days later, Mazamette and Philipe\u2019s mother pick up Jane and her mother in the night in order to take them to a safe retreat near Fontainebleau. Irma, who tries to fill the getaway car with soporific gas, is spotted by Mazamette, but Irma gasses him, and he is taken away asleep while Irma hides in a box on the car. Mazamette is dumped on the street and taken to the police station, believed to be drunk. When he wakens, he calls Philipe to warn him, but Irma slips out of the box and gets away in the car before Philipe can catch her. Irma jumps off the car near the Pyramid Hotel, and calls Venomous to meet her there, but Philipe has also arranged to meet Mazamette there. Philipe spots Irma at the Pyramid Hotel, captures her and ties her up. Philipe and Mazamette leave Irma in Mazamette's car and attempt to ambush Venomous, but Irma honks the car horn to warn him. Venomous saves Irma and drives off in Mazamette\u2019s car, so Philipe and Mazamette chase him in his. Venomous leaps off; Philipe chases Venomous on foot, following him onto the top of a moving train, but Venomous gets away. Mazamette, enraged at the police for not letting him help Philipe on the train, hits one of the officers, who arrest him. At the police station, Philipe and Mazamette carry on so dramatically that the police decide not to book Mazamette, who is after all a famous philanthropist. But the Vampires are still on the loose.\n=== Episode 10 \u2013 \"The Terrible Wedding\" ===\nA few months have passed, and Philipe and Jane are now married. Augustine Charlet (Germaine Rouer), widow of the poisoned concierge, is hired by the Gu\u00e9randes to be their chamber maid. Augustine, still tormented by the mysterious poisoning death of her husband, receives an advertising circular for a psychic, Madame d\u2019Alba of 13 Avenue Junot, and decides to consult her. Madame d\u2019Alba, a Vampire, hypnotises Augustine and instructs her to unlock the door of Philipe\u2019s apartment at 2 am. Mazamette, who has taken an attraction to Augustine, awakens that night and sees her descend the stairs to unlock the door. The Vampires enter, tie her up, and feed poisonous gas into the Gu\u00e9randes\u2019 room. Mazamette shoots at them and they flee, and Augustine explains her actions. As they go to the police, Venomous tries to break in through a bedroom window, but Jane shoots at him. When she looks out the window she is lassoed down and carried away. At daybreak, the police raid Avenue Junot; however Irma and Venomous escape through the roof and a bomb is left behind. Augustine is recaptured by the Vampires during their escape. Mazamette shoots at the getaway car, causing an oil leak. Philipe follows the trail to the Vampires\u2019 lair and discovers Augustine and Jane, to whom he passes a gun before leaving. Returning at night, he sets up an escape during the celebration of Irma's marriage to Venomous. At daybreak, the police prepare for a massive raid as the party continues. The police burst in and a running gun battle ensues, ending when the remaining Vampires (save Irma) are driven out onto the balcony which Philipe earlier rigged and are killed in the fall. Irma prepares to kill Jane and Augustine, but Jane shoots her dead. A few days later Mazamette makes a proposal of marriage to Augustine, which she accepts. The film ends with the two couples (Philipe and Jane, and Mazamette and Augustine) standing side by side."}
