{"mid": "EndlessLove", "IMDB_id": "tt2318092", "title": "Endless Love", "plot": "The opening scene is a high school graduation, class of 2014. Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde), a shy but beautiful young woman, is graduating. She is going to be attending Brown University in the fall. She stands alone after the ceremony, while everyone else laughs with friends and takes pictures together. Jade quietly rejoins her parents while reminiscing about her older brother, Chris, who passed away from cancer. David (Alex Pettyfer), another student graduating, observes her from a distance and notices how lonely she seems. He is intrigued by her, but doesn't speak to her. His best friend, Mace teases him about crushing on her for 4 years but never speaking to her and he brings up David ex-girlfriend, Jenny.Jade, her parents, Hugh and Anne, and her older brother Keith stop at an upscale restaurant to eat lunch after the graduation. Her father pulls the car up for valet service. While exiting the car, Jade bumps into David and Mace, who work as the valets at the restaurant. She shyly says 'hello' and walks inside behind her parents, but comes outside again to ask David to sign her yearbook. Inside the restaurant, Jade's father asks her what she would like as a graduation present. Jade asks for a party. She's never had the chance to socialize with her peers before. (Its clear that Jade has lived a very sheltered, caged life after the death of her brother.) Although her mother thinks its a wonderful idea, her father thinks its a bit odd, but agrees nonetheless. Jade goes out to invites David to her party. A snobby client drives up in his fancy car and treats David and Mace rudely, so they grab Jade and go joy riding in his car. As Jade's family leaves the restaurant they observe David getting into a physical altercation with the snobby client who insulted Jade. After punching the client David gets fired on the spot.Jade wears a beautiful red dress for her graduation party. Her home is full of her father, Hugh's wealthy, middle-aged friends. None of her classmates have shown up. David arrives. Jade is happy to see him, but she feels bad that none of her classmates have come. David explains that there is another graduation party taking place the same evening and that everyone is probably there. He takes out his phone, calls the police and makes a fake noise complaint about the other party, effectively shutting it down. Soon, lots of classmates begin to arrive at Jade's house. Everyone drinks, dances and has fun. Jade and David sneak into a closet to kiss just as Jades father gathers everyone together to make a speech. He talks about how proud he is of Jade and attempts to make a toast, however Jade is nowhere to be found. She sheepishly comes out of the closet, closely followed by David. Her father is annoyed, but continues with the toast. He thanks everyone for coming and ends his speech by asking them all to leave. David leaves after apologizing to Jade's father. He knows he's made a bad first impression but makes it clear that he cares for Jade very much.Jade races to her balcony and throws a paper plane down to David. It says, Wait until all the lights are off. David waits in the pouring rain until the lights are off. He sneaks back into the house and walks into a room where Jade is waiting for him. There's a large cozy fire in the fireplace and shes wearing a beautiful, white negligee. They begin to kiss passionately, undress and spend the night together. Its clear that Jade and David are completely smitten with each other.The next day, Jade spends time with her father at the hospital. He is a doctor and is grooming her to go into medical school. He asks her to stay and observe a surgery, but she tells him that she can't. He is disappointed and taken aback by her not following his wishes, since she usually does. She meets David near a lake and kisses him intensely. They discuss a summer medical internship she has, which means they only have about 10 days left to spend together. David tells her that he doesn't care how much time they have, he wants to enjoy it to the fullest. A very sweet montage shows them riding bicycles, running through fields and enjoying each others company with reckless abandon. David drops Jade home after their last evening together. She tells him to ask her to stay, instead of leaving for the internship. He does, and she agrees. She goes inside and begins to unpack. When her father asks her why, she tells him she changed her mind about the internship. Her father knows its because of David. He is furious. The next morning, Jade awakes to find her entire family packing. Her father has decided to take everyone to the lake house. Jade is upset and doesn't want to go, but he father doesn't give her a choice. Shortly after they arrive at the lake house, the doorbell rings. Its David.
