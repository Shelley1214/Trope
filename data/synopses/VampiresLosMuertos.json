{"mid": "VampiresLosMuertos", "IMDB_id": "tt0272147", "title": "Vampires: Los Muertos", "plot": "NOTE: Sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires (1998).Los Muertos picks up after the vampires went south into Mexico and Father Guiteau stashed the Bersier\ncross in a monastery. Vampire hunter Derek Bliss [Jon Bon Jovi] has been commissioned to seek and destroy\nsome vampires in northern Mexico before they can move north to San Diego\nand other places in the U.S. The only problem is that the unnamed client\nwants to hire a team, not someone working solo. Getting together a team is\na bit difficult for Derek because everyone on Chief Brody's recommended\nlist keeps turning up dead. Father Guiteau, who was a member of the\noriginal team lead by Jack Crow, died last month. All the priests at the\nmonastery where he moved the Bersier cross were killed by vampires only a\nday or two after Derek came looking for Guiteau.Eventually, Derek manages to put together a team, unlikely as it is.\nIt consists of Zoey [Natasha Wagner] (a woman he met in a diner who was bitten by a vampire\nbut who has been able to keep the turning in remission by taking some\nanti-HIV pills she got in Mexico City), Father Rodrigo[Cristian de la Fuente] (the only priest\nwho escaped the massacre at the monastery), Sancho [Diego Luna] (a 15-year old boy who\naccompanied Derek on a vampire hunt and who found that he had a penchant\nfor it), and Ray Collins [Darius McCrary] (a tall, muscular, black, ex-military, \"tough as\nnails\" guy recruited in Memphis by Brody). To help with the hunt, Rodrigo\noffers Derek the use of Guiteau's vampire-hunting bus, which is outfitted\nwith all the winches and gizmos that are needed to hunt vampires (or\n\"suckers,\" as the team calls them).The attack on the monastery, Rodrigo explains, was led by the new\nfemale master Una [Arly Jover] in order to get\nback the Bersier cross. It looks like she intends to again perform the\nritual which the suckers believe will allow them to walk during the day.\nAfter meeting up with Collins in Nogales, they cross over into Mexico.\nZoey, due to her blood connection with the vampires, has a vision of Una\nperforming the ceremony, but it doesn't seem to have worked. The sun still\nhurts her. Given a map of Mexico, Zoey is able to pinpoint where she\nthinks the bloodsuckers are hiding...someplace called Salina, near some\nold Toltec ruins. They stop for the night to sleep, but Collins is getting\nclaustrophobic in the little bus and chooses to sleep outside. During the\nnight, he is, unknown to anyone, bitten by Una. The next day is spent\ndriving further into Mexico. They know that they are getting close when\nthey stop for gas and cold drinks and find that everyone in the diner has\nbeen slaughtered.The next morning, they near Salina. Rather than going directly to the\nruins, they stop in Salina where the residents are celebrating the Day of\nthe Dead (\"Los muertos\" means \"the dead\"). When Zoey goes to take her\nmeds, she finds them missing and says that she must go immediately to\nMexico City. Actually, Una has them, and she's downed every last one. This\ngives Una the ability, albeit it temporary, to move about during daylight,\nand she uses that opportunity to find and kidnap Zoey. Rodrigo puts 2+2\ntogether and concludes that Una took Zoey's meds. But the only ones who\nhad access to them were the rest of the team, so Derek holds them all at\ngunpoint, trying to find the culprit. Turns out that it was Collins, who\nis shot by an old man they just met that morning in Salina. With his dying\nbreath, Collins reveals that the client who hired them is none other than\nUna.Although they now know that this entire vampire hunt is a set-up, the\nremaining team members plus the old man, filling in for Collins, go to the\nruins to rescue Zoey. Zoey has fallen into a deep shaft and needs to be\nlifted out. Derek tosses her a rope, telling the old man to stay far\nenough behind him to watch his back while still keeping his eye on Rodrigo\nand Sancho, who are closer to the exit. While they are so separated, Una\nattacks Derek. Just as she's about to bite his neck, Fr Rodrigo offers Una\na deal. Let his friends go, and he'll offer himself, as a priest, to\nperform the ceremony. In addition, he points out, he is also a hunter--two\nof the necessary elements of the ritual. Una agrees.Rodrigo stays with Una while the others go to a clinic where Zoey is\ntransfused with blood while her infected blood is removed in hopes that\nthis will slow her turning. Then Derek gets a brainstorm. He asks the\nnurse to transfuse Zoey's tainted blood into him so that he can slow his\nheartbeat and infiltrate the vampires without being noticed.\nAs the sun sets, the team goes back to the ruins where the ritual is\ntaking place. Una has slit Rodrigo's leg and drunk a cup of his blood when\nRodrigo mentions that the ritual won't work because he was merely a hired\nhand at the monastery, not a priest at all. Ha ha, fooled you! Derek,\nwhose plan to lurk is working, shoots several suckers, saves Rodrigo from\nbeing burned alive, and fires an arrow through Una. Unfortunately, the\nwinch is on the fritz, and they can't pull her out into the sun.So, they\nfix the winch and go back into the ruins. Sancho ropes Una, Una grabs\nDerek, Zoey pulls both Una and Derek out into the sun, Derek shoots off\nUna's head, and Una burns up. [I wonder whether they'll get paid now that\nthey've killed their client?]Epilogue: Rodrigo stays in Salina, Sancho is sent home to his mother, and Derek\nand Zoey drive off together into the sunset, headed for Mexico City, as\nthey are both in need of those meds.
