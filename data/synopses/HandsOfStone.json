{"mid": "HandsOfStone", "IMDB_id": "tt1781827", "title": "Hands of Stone", "plot": "The film follows the life of Panamanian boxing legend Roberto Dur\u00e1n, who made his professional boxing debut in 1968 as a 16-year-old and retired in 2001 at age 50.\nGrowing up in Panama, Dur\u00e1n is homeschooled by Chaflan, who teaches young Roberto some vital life lessons. Later, Duran joins a boxing club with Nestor \"Plomo\" Qui\u00f1ones as his coach.\nAs he reaches 20, an American legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel, who nearly lost his life after being attacked by an unknown assailant in 1953 in New York City and is now living with his wife Stephanie, notices Roberto's raw talent and punching power and takes the young fighter under his wing, becoming his coach. Not long after, Dur\u00e1n then meets a student, Felicidad, with whom he later has five children.\nAfter his fights through the 70s and 80s, rising through the divisions with phenomenal success (just one loss) he challenges Sugar Ray Leonard, dubbed as the \"Fighter of the Year.\" However, Dur\u00e1n is disrespectful of Leonard, describing him as a \"clown\" who tries to \"imitate Muhammad Ali\" and that \"he punches like a girl\", and confidently predicts a knock out win for himself.\nOne night, Dur\u00e1n confronts Leonard in front of his wife and insults him by calling him a \"homosexual.\" The incident frustrates Ray. Dur\u00e1n's hard feelings for Ray, on the other hand seem to stem from his resentment of Americans in general, because he recalls the ill-treatment meted out by the Americans to the nation of Panama, remembering how American troops took over the country by owning the Panama Canal \u2014 leading to conflict between both the sides in 1964.\nIn June 1980, the day of fight between Dur\u00e1n and Leonard in which the venue is in Montreal, Dur\u00e1n wins via Unanimpus decision as a Welterweight Champion (148-147, 145-144, 146-144). After the fight, Leonard states that being insulted is a strategy and calls for a rematch with an $8 million purse. At the house party, informed by his manager Carlos Eleta, Dur\u00e1n reluctantly agrees to the rematch but it is impossible for him to prepare for a November fight. Chaflan is later killed after being ran over by a truck.\nIn November 1980, Dur\u00e1n and Leonard face at the ring for the second time, this time the venue is in New Orleans. But in the eighth round, the people of Panama are shocked when Dur\u00e1n gives up by saying \"No m\u00e1s\" (English: \"No more\") to the referee, thus Leonard wins via technical knockout (68\u201366, 68\u201366, and 67\u201366).\nUpon returning home in Panama, he faces angry protests. Dur\u00e1n tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Ray is retired from his training and tells Dur\u00e1n that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of his fight against Davey Moore, Leonard gratefully meets Dur\u00e1n for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Dur\u00e1n. He tells Leonard that he gives his apology to his wife. At the fight with Moore up to the eighth round, now Leonard is now commentator, Dur\u00e1n won via technical knockout, eventually restores his popularity and pride by the people of Panama.\nIn the film's epilogue, it states that Plomo was in Dur\u00e1n's side for each fight until his death in 2012; Leonard and Dur\u00e1n remain friends until now; Ray was the first boxing trainer to be elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame and died of leukemia in 1994 after the six-year battle."}
