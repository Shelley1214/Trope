{"mid": "Ultraviolet", "IMDB_id": "tt0370032", "title": "Ultraviolet", "plot": "In the mid-21st century, the Hemaglophagic virus (HGV), an obscure virus\nfrom Eastern Europe which was being used to breed stronger and faster soldiers,\nescaped the laboratory. Once infected, people have a lifespan of about 12\nyears, but first they are reduced to \"hemophages\" (aka \"vampires\"). They take on many characteristics including extended eyeteeth, regeneration, accelerated reflexes and increased strength.\nOne of the victims is Violet Song jat Shariff [Milla Jovovich]. Because she was infected\nwhile pregnant, Violet was secured to a holding camp to be studied. Most of the\nother hemophages have been wiped out, thanks to the actions of Vice cardinal\nFerdinand Daxus [Nick Chinlund], who is determined to wipe out every last hemophage. But the\nhemophages aren't going to be led like sheep to their slaughter. Hemophages\nhave united, and their resistance and terrorist attacks have become known as\n\"the Blood War.\"It is 12 years later. The scientists terminated Violet's pregnancy, and\nshe has managed to escape the camp and join the Hemophage Underground. After\ninfiltrating the Archministry by posing as courier XPD154, Violet finds herself\nin possession of a case that contains the ultimate weapon against Hemophages,\none that will wipe out the entire hemophagic population. When ordered by her\nHemophagic superior, Nerva [Sebastien Andrieu], to destroy the case without opening it, which will\nset off a bomb that will destroy everything a block around, Violet refuses to\ncomply and opens the case to discover it contains a child. It is both a weapon\nand a child, she is told. The child contains antigens that will wipe out all\nexisting Hemophages. What is Violet to do...destroy the weapon or protect the\nchild?The child is a ten-year human named Six [Cameron Bright], because he is a clone of eight.\nHe has been raised all his life in a laboratory and knows very little about\nlife outside. Violet takes Six to be examined by her Hemophagic friend Garth [William Fichtner],\nwho learns that Six has only eight hours to live and that he is outfitted with\na tracking device, so Violet must keep moving lest Daxus catches up with her.\nUnfortunately, Nerva has made a deal with Daxus and learned that Six doesn't\ncontain an antigen against Hemophagia but against the entire human race, so\nNerva seizes Six with the idea of using him against the humans. Violet sets Six\nfree again. In the time they have left before Six dies, Violet takes him to the\npark. When the time comes, Violet is at his side, but Daxus and his henchmen\nshow up to claim the body and kill Violet.Fortunately for Violet, Garth manages to retrieve her body before Daxus's\nincendiary team can destroy it. After several hours of surgery, Garth is able\nto bring Violet back to life. Violet goes into a deep depression but recovers\nwhen she senses that Six is not dead and that he needs her help to get away\nfrom Daxus. Violet storms the Archministry just as Daxus is about to saw into\nSix's brain. Violet single-handedly wipes out everyone in the Archministry\nexcept for Daxus. As they face each other, Daxus tells Violet the truth about\nhimself...he is actually a Hemophage, too. Violet defeats him with a flame pistol and her sword.Epilogue: Violet carries Six to the roof and reawakens him. Six is surprised to\nstill be alive; a flashback reveals one of Violet's tears at the park protected him from dying by giving him immunity to what was killing him. He tells Violet that there is a cure for Hemophagia."}
