Whoever tries to get in their way, they will show no mercy.

But he soon comes face with the cruel reality that the usual police tactics are too futile to send these armed thieves behind bars. Extreme crime requires extreme justice, even if it means crossing his moral line. To Shing-bong (Gordon Lam), an ex-con desperate to leave his criminal past behind, volunteers to be Lui\u2019s informant in exchange for a fresh start with his girlfriend Yin Bing (Yao Chen). But little does he know what hellish situation he is getting himself into.\nWhile Nam is putting together his next big score, the two colliding forces from both sides of the law, each at the top of their games, will soon face their archenemies. As Lui\u2019s hunt heats up, their ultimate confrontation is about to take place on the streets.\nAs the storm passes through and the dust settles, whoever survives can hardly cope with its horrifying aftermath."}
