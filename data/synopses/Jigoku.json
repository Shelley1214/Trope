{"mid": "Jigoku", "IMDB_id": "tt0269401", "title": "Jigoku", "plot": "A young Tokyo theology student, Shir\u014d (Shigeru Amachi), is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), the daughter of his professor, Mr. Yajima. After announcing the engagement, Shir\u014d's dark and unsettling colleague, Tamura (Y\u00f4ichi Numata), drives Shir\u014d home, suggesting that Shir\u014d had been sleeping with Yukiko for some time. Taking a side street at Shir\u014d's request, Tamura hits and kills drunken yakuza gang leader, Ky\u014dichi. Though Shir\u014d wants to stop, Tamura keeps driving, stating that it does not concern him and that ultimately, the murder is Shir\u014d's fault for asking him to drive down the street. Unbeknown to either of them, Ky\u014dichi's mother (Kiyoko Tsuji) witnessed everything and resolves to find and kill them.\nThough Tamura feels no guilt for the murder, Shir\u014d does and attempts to go to the police. After telling Yukiko of what happened, Shir\u014d insists that they take a taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to walk instead. While in the cab, Shir\u014d hallucinates that Tamura is driving the cab, and it crashes, killing Yukiko. After her funeral, Shir\u014d seeks solace in the arms of strip bar worker and Ky\u014dichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko (Akiko Ono), who discovers Shir\u014d's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping with him and, with Ky\u014dichi's mother, plots revenge.\nShir\u014d receives a telegram that his mother, Ito, who lives in a country-side retirement community run by his father, G\u014dz\u014d, is dying and rushes to see her. There, he meets the other residents including a disgraced painter, Ensai, who is painting a portrait of Hell, a former reporter, Akagawa, a corrupt detective, Hariya, and the community doctor, Dr. Kasuma. He meets Sachiko (also played by Mitsuya), a nurse and Ensai's daughter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko, and is taking care of his mother. During his stay, Shir\u014d and Sachiko become close while each of the residents' sordid activities are revealed: His father carries on an open affair while his mother lays dying and also cheats the community of its money by cutting corners; the painter is wanted for a crime in another city; the detective threatens to turn the painter in unless he gives her Sachiko to marry; and the doctor knows his diagnoses are wrong, but feels seeking a second opinion too cumbersome. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yajima, both despondent after Yukiko's death, arrive by train to pay their respects to Shir\u014d's mother. Ito dies, and Ensai blames G\u014dz\u014d; decades ago, he and Ito were lovers before G\u014dz\u014d came between them and married her leaving her unhappy. Inexplicably, Tamura appears and reveals that each of the residents has some complicity in a murder: Mr. Yajima killed his comrade during the war, stealing his water for himself; both the detective and reporter framed or slandered innocent men who then both committed suicide; and the doctor knew his diagnosis of Ito's condition was wrong, but chose not to tell anyone.\nYoko tracks Shir\u014d down and meets with him on a rope bridge in the area. There she reveals her identity and attempts to shoot him while Ky\u014dichi's mother watches from the trees, but she trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and the two struggle over the gun, and Tamura also falls into the gorge. Shir\u014d stumbles back in time for the community's tenth anniversary party, where G\u014dz\u014d has knowingly allowed cheap, rancid fish to be served to the residents. As the party descends into debauchery, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima both decide to leap in front of the train, killing themselves, and G\u014dz\u014d's mistress falls to her death following an altercation. The residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Ky\u014dichi's mother sneaks into the party, poisoning the remaining residents' wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko, while Ky\u014dichi's mother strangles Shir\u014d to death and then commits suicide.\nIn Limbo, Shir\u014d encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with his child, a baby girl named \"Harumi\", but has sent her floating away on the river of the underworld and begs Shir\u014d to save her. Shir\u014d enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment in the Eight Realms of Hell by Lord Enma for his sins. While running through Hell to find his daughter, he encounters each of his acquaintances, who suffer, in gruesome fashion, a variety of punishments for their sins, such as being boiled and burned alive, dismembered and flayed, or cut apart and beaten by ogres, only to be revived to suffer anew. Meanwhile, Tamura taunts Shir\u014d, saying there is no escape from Hell, before being butchered for giving his soul over to evil. In a realm filled with glass shards jutting from the ground, Shir\u014d finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Shir\u014d's mother, who shamefully reveals that Sachiko is his sister: Shir\u014d is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually her daughter, also a product of her later affair with Ensai. Shir\u014d is disgusted with his family, and continues searching for his daughter, determined to live and save her. While caught in a vortex of damned souls, he finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on the Buddhist wheel of life. Lord Enma gives Shir\u014d one chance to save his daughter, otherwise she too will suffer for all eternity in Hell. As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his mother call to him, Shir\u014d leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter.\nThe moment is frozen in time, revealed to be nine o'clock: the exact time that everyone at the party has finally died, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after completing his portrait of Hell and set it on fire. In a final scene, both Sachiko and Yukiko stand smiling in peaceful light, calling to Shir\u014d as lover and sister, respectively, with lotus petals falling around them, symbolizing mental and moral purity."}
