{"mid": "TheLastEmperor", "IMDB_id": "tt0093389", "title": "The Last Emperor", "plot": "Arrival.\nA train pulls into a station in North China.\nIt's 1950.\nSoldiers are everywhere.\nThe train is a prisoner transport and all who depart from it are war criminals.The prisoners are hustled into the station building to wait.\nAfter a short while, four prisoners suddenly get up, congregate across the room, and worshipfully prostrate themselves before a well dressed, bespectacled man (John Lone).\nThe venerated man looks around uncomfortably.\nGuards lead the four worshipers away.\nThe man retreats to a bathroom and locks the door behind him.\nAfter filling a sink with hot water he slits his wrists and plunges them into the water.A short time later the prison governor (Ruocheng Ying) goes to the bathroom door.\nFinding it locked the governor pounds on the door, repeatedly shouting, \"Open the door!\"\nInside the bathroom, the venerated man, prisoner, war criminal, watches his blood cloud the water in the sink.\nThe man's name is Pu Yi.\nHe is the last emperor of China.The Emperor of China, 1908.\nThe sound of the governor's pounding and shouting transports Pu Yi's thoughts to a time, 42 years earlier, when mounted soldiers similarly demanded entry to his family's estate.\nBy command of the Empress Dowager Cixi, three year-old Pu Yi (Richard Vuu) has been ordered to the Forbidden City, the seat of power and abode of Chinese emperors.\nAs the boy sobs, Pu Yi's mother (Dong Liang) hands him over to his nurse, Ar Mo (Jade Go), saying, \"My son is your son.\"When the procession arrives in the Forbidden City, Pu Yi and his father (Basil Pao) are given audience before the dying Empress Dowager.\nHer last official act is to proclaim the boy to be the successor of the previous emperor, who has died that very day.\n\"Little Pu Yi. I have decided that you will be the new Lord of Ten Thousand Years. You will be the Son of Heaven.\"\nWith those words, the Empress Dowager dies.\nPu Yi turns to his father and asks if they are going home.\nWithout reply, his father prostrates himself before his son.Shortly, Pu Yi is seated on the imperial throne in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.\nHe is being invested.\nAs the imperial seal is imprinted on the proclamation, Pu Yi bolts out of the hall and into the huge courtyard beyond.\nThousands of government officials and household servants are arrayed in ranks in the courtyard and in the square beyond.\nTo rhythmic chants and commands, they all kowtow to the new emperor in a seemingly endless series of prostrations.\nWhen they are done and silence finally arrives, the sound of a cricket reaches Pu Yi's ears.\nThe High Tutor (Victor Wong), makes the cricket a gift: \"Ah. See? He is kowtowing to Your Majesty. Now he can be the emperor's cricket.\"Later, the boy emperor is attended by court eunuchs.\nThey bathe him and entertain him while the imperial physician (Zhendong Dong) checks his stool.\nAr Mo arrives and Pu Yi flies into her arms exclaiming, \"I want to go home!\"\nThat night Pu Yi and Ar Mo are in bed together.\nShe sings him a lullaby.Failed Suicide.\nThe remembrance of Ar Mo's lullaby is interrupted by the prison governor.\nHe is slapping Pu Yi's face.\n\"Where am I?\" the adult Pu Yi asks from where he lies on the bathroom floor.\n\"In the People's Republic of China,\" the governor curtly replies.\nPu Yi's suicide attempt has failed.The prisoners are trucked to the Bureau of Public Security Detention Center in Fushun.\nThey are given supplies and the rules of conduct.\nAs Pu Yi sits on the plank bed in his cell later that day, his brother, Pu Chieh (Guang Fan), arrives.Brothers, 1914.\nThe sight of his brother launches Pu Yi into another recollection.\nIn it, eight year-old Pu Yi (Tsou Tijger) is paid a visit by his family.\nThough he has not seen them since his coronation, Pu Yi doesn't seem very interested and must be prompted by the High Tutor.\nAs seven year-old Pu Chieh (Henry Kyi) kowtows to his brother, Pu Yi callously steps over him and, calling for Ar Mo to accompany him, approaches his mother's curtained sedan chair.\nPerfunctorily, he inquires of her health and, when the curtains part, admits that he does not remember her face.\nTheir father ignores Pu Chieh's shout of \"Papa!\" and abruptly departs.\nPu Chieh is being left in the Forbidden City to serve as companion to his brother.Pu Chieh tells his imperial brother that if he comes home Pu Yi can play with his three sisters and two friends but Pu Yi says that he never leaves the palace.\nThen the emperor shows his brother a game that he does play.\nIt's follow the leader as, at a run, the two boys lead the imperial entourage in circles.\nPu Yi next takes his brother to a lake where, while Pu Chieh dawdles, Pu Yi casually stokes Ar Mo's breast and then suckles it in plain view and to no apparent surprise or disapproval.\nLater, the two boys have a trifling dispute that leads to a revelation.\nThe dispute is over whether Pu Chieh is wearing a color of yellow that is reserved for the emperor.\nWhen Pu Chieh tells his brother that he's not the emperor anymore, that there's a new emperor, Pu Yi tries to disprove his claim by commanding a eunuch called Big Foot (Liangbin Zhang) to drink a bowl of green ink.\nAfter considerable pause and with much apprehension Big Foot drinks the ink, but Pu Chieh doesn't accept that as proof and persists.\nHe leads his brother to the top of a newly constructed wall built to divide the northern residential section from the rest of the Forbidden City.\nPu Chieh points to a man riding in a car below claiming, \"He's the president of the republic.\"Pu Yi is shaken.\nWhen he descends to street level, he asks the High Tutor if he is still emperor.\nThe High Tutor replies, \"You will always be the emperor inside the Forbidden City, but not outside.\nOutside\", Pu Yi is informed, \"China is now a republic, with a president.\"Seeking solace, Pu Yi searches for Ar Mo but she is gone.\nHe is told that she has been sent away to promote a more healthful environment.Prison Orientation.\nPu Yi and Pu Chieh, prisoners number 981 and 920 respectively, together with hundreds of other war criminals are assembled in the prison yard.\nThe prison governor briefs them.\nThey are expected to face the truth by writing autobiographies in which they confess their crimes.In his office following the orientation, the prison governor unwraps a parcel to reveal a book titled Twilight in the Forbidden City, written by Reginald F. Johnston.\nHe turns to a section near the middle of the book and begins reading.Education, 1919.\nReginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole) enters into the emperor's service as tutor during the turmoil of the 1919 May Fourth student movement.\nYears of deferential laxity have left fifteen year-old Pu Yi (Tao Wu) ignorant, naive, and more than a little arrogant.\nJohnston immediately sees that to have influence he must be the emperor's friend, not his vassal.\nFor his part, Pu Yi uses Johnston as his only source for genuine information about conditions outside the Forbidden City.\nJohnston gives Pu Yi a bicycle upon which the emperor attempts an escape.\nWhen that fails, Pu Yi tries a rooftop escape and fails again.\nWhen Johnston determines that the lad needs spectacles, he must threaten to publicize the pathetic facts of the emperor's captivity to coerce the Lord Chamberlain into allowing the emperor to wear them.Marriage, 1922.\nThe government decides that Pu Yi is to be married.\nHe is shown a series of pictures of teenaged princesses from which he presumably can reject - it is only the government that will select the empress.\nPu Yi, however, chooses to have a secondary consort, and in the matter of a second wife, he can do the choosing.\nHe chooses twelve year-old Wen Hsiu (Jun Wu).After the wedding ceremony, he is seated on a bed with Wan Jung (Joan Chen), the empress that has been selected for him.\nHe removes the kai t'ou that covers her face to discover that despite being so old - she's two years his senior - she's gorgeous.\nAs Wan Jung covers Pu Yi's face with kisses, attendants begin removing the royal wedding clothes but Pu Yi stops them.\nWan Jung asks whether he would prefer them to be a modern couple.\nWhen he doesn't respond, she takes his silence for assent.\nThey shake hands, say goodnight, and Pu Yi leaves.Testimony.\nThe prison governor has apparently stopped reading.\nPu Yi is taken from his cell to a wainscoted room where he is to confess his crimes.\nHe is told to first write his name.\nSince he has been given only chalk and the floor is slate, he writes his name on the floor.\nHis interrogator (Ric Young) establishes the ground rules and then begins by asking Pu Yi why he thinks he's there.\nFrom Pu Yi's response and his autobiography one might think him an innocent bystander to China's recent history.\nThe interrogator figuratively throws both Pu Yi's response and his autobiography back into his face.\nHe demands serious confession.\nA scribe (Hongchang Yang) is ready to take Pu Yi's testimony.\nThe prison governor has entered and sits at the rear of the interrogation room.Trivial Confession, 1923.\nPu Yi begins his confession.\nHe recalls sitting on a golden armchair espousing reforms.\nHe cuts off his queue, the woven ponytail that signifies Manchu domination, the cutting of which was, until recently, treasonous.\nHe then replaces the Lord Chamberlain and proposes an audit of the imperial storerooms.\nThat night the eunuchs burn the storerooms to prevent discovery of their thefts.\nThe next day, Pu Yi expels the eunuchs with the help of republican troops.Inadequate.\nPu Yi finishes his trivial \"confession\" staring at his name on the floor.\nThe prison governor asks about the Japanese.\nThey all passionately want to know about the Japanese.\nHow and when did Pu Yi's friendship with the Japanese begin?Expulsion from the Forbidden City, 1924.\nPu Yi continues his testimony.\nThe imperial family is playing tennis in a courtyard.\nShots are heard in the distance.\nSuddenly, the courtyard is filled with troops of the warlord Feng Yuxiang.\nOne of Feng's captains (Xu Tongrui) gives the imperials one hour to leave the Forbidden City.\nThey are to go into guarded exile at Pu Yi's ancestral estate.\nJohnston suggests that he could arrange asylum in the British Embassy.As Pu Yi leaves what for him has been a gold encrusted prison for the first time in sixteen years, he's quiet and strangely apprehensive.\nThe imperial family departs my motorcar as the five-color republican flag is raised over the Forbidden City.Explanations.\nThe interrogator points out that they didn't go to the British Embassy, but to the Japanese Embassy.\nPu Yi explains that the Japanese were prepared to help, that they have an emperor nearly his age, and that, since he is Manchurian, many Chinese consider him to be an alien.\nHe presents these facts to explain why the imperial family went to live in the Japanese Concession in Tientsin.\nHe further explains that he was not in the pay of the Japanese, that he had to pay his own way in Tientsin by selling family treasure, and that he dreamed of going to the West.The Playboy, 1927.\nPu Yi relates the casual good times in Tientsin.\nIt was a cosmopolitan city with a large international community.\nAt a dance party, a tuxedo-clad Pu Yi briefly sings Am I Blue? flanked by a jazz band that bizarrely wears blackface.\nHe finishes the song and rejoins the dancers.\nThe grown up Wen Hsiu (Vivian Wu), his secondary consort, dances with an American while Masahiko Amakasu (Ryuichi Sakamoto), Pu Yi's Japanese patron and co-conspirator, looks on.While they dance, Pu Yi and Wan Jung discuss where they want to live.\nShe favors Monaco but he prefers San Francisco.\nShe asks if they're really going this time.The American dancing with Wen Hsiu sees the imperial couple and asks who they are.\nWen Hsiu identifies them as Henry and Elizabeth - Pu Yi and Wan Jung have taken Western names.As they drive to their residence in the Japanese legation after the party, Wen Hsiu announces that she wants a divorce.\nHenry chides her saying that no one can divorce him.\nShortly after they arrive at the residence Wen Hsiu leaves never to return.Later that night Eastern Jewel (Maggie Han) arrives.\nIn her bedroom, she and Elizabeth engage in small talk and then Eastern Jewel produces an opium pipe.\nAs she prepares the pipe, she casually explains that she works as a spy for the Japanese Special Service Bureau.\nElizabeth naively confides in Eastern Jewel.\nShe shares her worries about Henry and his relationship with the Japanese.\nHenry has sent his brother, Pu Chieh, to a military academy in Tokyo, and Amakasu speaks incessantly to Henry about Manchuria.\nElizabeth doesn't trust Amakasu and she doesn't trust the Japanese.Henry appears and greets Eastern Jewel as \"cousin.\"\nHe is still upset by Wen Hsiu's departure.\nEastern Jewel stokes the fires of Henry's discontent by informing him of the recent desecration of the tombs of their Manchu ancestors by Kuomintang troops.\nHenry is left speechless.Questions.\nThe interrogator grills Pu Yi about whether he collaborated with the Japanese in their transformation of Manchuria into the puppet state, Manchukuo.\nHe points out that Pu Yi arrived in Manchuria within a month of the Japanese conquest.\nWhen Pu Yi insists that he was kidnapped, the prison governor intercedes.\nThe governor asks if Pu Yi remembers Mr. Johnston.Farewell, 1931.\nPu Yi tries evasion by relating the day that Johnston left China to return to England.\nAfter their farewells, Henry Pu Yi watches from the car as Johnston walks to the gangplank of the waiting ship.\nA small Chinese orchestra plays Auld Lang Syne on traditional Chinese instruments.Contradictions.\nThe prison governor dismisses Pu Yi's evasion.\nHe counters Pu Yi's claim of kidnap by reading aloud contradictory quotations from Johnston's book.\nPu Yi calls Johnston a liar and points out that his old tutor had left China years before the putative kidnapping.\nAt a nod from the interrogator, the scribe goes to the back of the interrogation room and opens the door to admit Pu Yi's former valet, who is also a prisoner.\nThe interrogator resumes by pointing out that, in his autobiography, the valet had written that he packed Pu Yi's luggage the day before his master's \"kidnapping.\"\nHolding up the two conflicting accounts the interrogator exclaims, \"These two stories don't fit, do they?\"\nWhen the valet tries to make excuses, the interrogator angrily throws the books at them.Opportunity, 1932.\nPu Yi privately recalls the true events surrounding his \"kidnapping.\"\nThough it is obvious to Elizabeth that the Japanese are using him, Henry asserts his hereditary right to rule Manchuria.\nHe must find a way to use the Japanese.\n\"There can be no Manchukuo without me,\" he asserts.\nEven when faced by protest from his faithful old High Tutor, Henry proves that he's still an arrogant spoiled brat by bringing up every petty complaint that he has been harboring against the Chinese.\n\"China has turned its back on me,\" he rages.\nHe plans to take his opportunity to rule, no matter the circumstances or the consequences.\nPu Yi is in the hot embrace of megalomania.Time and Truth.\nThe prison governor leaves Pu Yi and his former valet looking at a 1934 copy of Time Magazine that displays a military portrait of Pu Yi on its cover with the words \"Emperor Pu Yi\" below.The Emperor of Manchukuo, 1934.\nThe sight of his picture on the cover of the magazine carries Pu Yi back to Manchuria.\nThe Japanese have decided that, having served as Head of State for the past two years, Henry Pu Yi is now to be emperor of Manchukuo.Henry arrives at his outdoor coronation wearing the traditional robes of the Qing Dynasty.\nWith Japanese officials looking on, he bows to the four points of the compass.\nThen, as the imperial seal is pressed to the instrument of coronation, Eastern Jewel congratulates Elizabeth.\n\"You're an empress again,\" she brightly exclaims.\nShe then enthusiastically confides to Elizabeth that she wants to bomb Shanghai.\n\"I hate China,\" she tells the newly restored empress.\n\"I hate you,\" Elizabeth replies sullenly.\nFrom the sidelines, Amakasu snaps photos.At the coronation ball that evening, Amakasu supervises the filming of the festivities.\nElizabeth and Eastern Jewel arrive stoned on opium.\nThe Japanese Army High Command is also present.\nGeneral Ishikari (Hideo Takamatsu) congratulates Henry on behalf of the Japanese Emperor.\nDuring this ceremony Elizabeth hides out on the second floor balcony.\nAmakasu turns his camera from the military pomp to film Elizabeth.\nHe stares at her with stony eyes, then follows her with the camera as she descends to the main floor.While the orchestra plays a Strauss waltz, Elizabeth does not join the dancers.\nInstead, she sits at the end of the hall and eats daffodils from a flower arrangement.\nShe stares vacantly as she stuffs the poisonous flowers into her mouth.\nNearby, Henry's brother, Pu Chieh, introduces his Japanese wife, Princess Hiro Saga, to various dignitaries.\nPu Chieh is wearing a full-dress Japanese uniform.\nHis wife is pregnant.When Henry is told of his wife's eccentric activities, he leaves a meeting with the High Command and confronts her.\nElizabeth tells her puffed up husband that he's blind to the reality of his situation: that Amakasu is the most powerful man in Manchukuo, to which Pu Yi scoffs.\nWhen she asks why he doesn't make love to her anymore, Henry says that it is because she has become an opium addict.\nShe tries to tell him how easily opium can be obtained in Manchukuo but Henry doesn't want to hear it.\nShe then asks to have a child.\n\"You must have an heir.\"\nHenry changes the subject by bringing up their invitation to Tokyo.\nHe tells her that he's decided to go alone.\nWhen she says that she would never go to Japan, Henry angrily tells her to go to her room.\nAs she leaves, she sarcastically raises a toast to the new emperor.\n\"Ten thousand years to His Majesty the Emperor!\"\nHenry abruptly stands in the face of her affront, but as the toast is picked up by the assembled guests a smile crosses his face.Elizabeth saunters out of the ballroom as the toasting continues.\nShe's followed by Eastern Jewel.\nBack in Elizabeth's bedroom, Eastern Jewel passes the opium pipe to her.\nThen, as Elizabeth stares dejectedly, Eastern Jewel rolls down Elizabeth's stockings and proceeds to nibble on her toes.\nElizabeth again tells Eastern Jewel that she hates her.\nUnsaid is that she hates all Chinese who collaborate with the Japanese.\nUnsaid is that she hates herself for putting up with the sham existence that her life has become.Servitude.\nBack in the prison, the governor spies on Pu Yi as the former emperor bullies his cellmates.\nThey had served him in the Forbidden City and they continue to serve him in prison.\nThe governor orders Pu Yi to be moved to a different cell, one that will humble Pu Yi.In the new cell that he is to share with five other convicts, Pu Yi is sternly told what chores he is expected to do.\nHe will be disallowed any privileged position here.\nPu Yi turns to the door and summons a guard.\n\"I've never been separated from my family,\" he says.\n\"You'd better get used to it,\" the guard replies.\nWhen he turns back to look at his cellmates, he recognizes them.\nThey were all government officials in Manchukuo.Welcome Home, 1935.\nThe sight of his cellmates carries Pu Yi back to Manchuria once again.\nHe is returning from Tokyo.\nDressed in military uniform, he reviews his troops when he is introduced to Colonel Yoshioka (Fumihiko Ikeda).\nBehind the colonel stands Mr. Amakasu.\nThe colonel has disarmed the imperial guards.\nHe informs Henry that there have been many changes made while he was away.Henry pushes the colonel aside and enters his palace.\nHe asks for his Prime Minister and is informed that the Prime Minister has resigned and has moved to a monastery far away.\nWhen Henry asks who it is that is telling him, the man identifies himself as Chang Chinghui (Shu Chen), Minister of Defense.Flanked by the flags of Japan and Manchukuo, Emperor Henry Pu Yi leads a meeting of his council.\nTo his right sit his Japanese advisers, facing the flag of Japan.\nTo his left sit his cabinet, facing the flag of Manchukuo.\nBefore him awaiting his signature lies an edict that would appoint Chang Chinghui as the new Prime Minister.\nHe refuses to sign and instead launches into an idealistic speech about mutual respect, equality, and independence.\nUpon mention of the name \"Manchuria,\" Amakasu on the Japanese side so violently stands up that his chair jumps back.\nAs Henry attempts to continue, the rest of the Japanese side stand up.\nThey turn and stiffly march out of the council chamber.\nThen, as the Emperor of Manchukuo once again tries to continue, Chang Chinghui abruptly stands up followed by the rest of the Manchukuo side.\nThey turn their backs on their emperor and fall in line behind the Japanese, marching briskly out of the room.\nHenry's government has been undermined by the Japanese while he was visiting Tokyo.\nHenry is left addressing an empty council chamber.\nAs his voice trails off and he slowly sits down, the emotion drains from Henry's face as a new, old realization strikes him.\nHe is back in a new Forbidden City of his own making.At the state dinner following the disastrous council meeting, Elizabeth informs her husband that she's pregnant and that the father is Manchurian.\nJust then, Colonel Yoshioka and Mr. Amakasu enter.\nYoshioka carries the edict that Henry refused to sign in the council chamber.\nHenry once again refuses to sign it.\nAmakasu insists that Manchukuo must, by rights, pay the cost of its occupation, that Japan's beneficent protection is not extended out of a sense of charity.\nHenry evades the issue by walking across the room to stand behind his wife's chair.\nHe announces that he is to have an heir.\nAmakasu looks at him impassively.\nHe tells Henry that the Japanese are aware of the situation.\nHe writes on a scrap of paper and replies, \"This is the name of the father.\"\nWith the paper in hand, Yoshioka faces Elizabeth across the table.\nHe tosses the paper on the table in front of her while loudly proclaiming, \"His name is Chang. He is your driver.\"\nAs Amakasu scolds the defeated emperor, Henry signs the instrument that appoints Chang Chinghui as Prime Minister.\nElizabeth stands as Amakasu picks up the document.\nTurning to face her, Amakasu triumphantly proclaims that \"The Japanese are the only divine race on Earth.\"\nShe turns away and begins to leave as he continues.\n\"We will take China, Hong Kong, Indochina, Siam, Malaya, Singapore, and India!\"\nAmakasu pursues Elizabeth across the room shouting, \"Asia belongs to us!\"The scene changes to a close up of Chang (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) as he waxes the emperor's car.\nHe stops when he feels a gun put to the back of his head.\nThe gun fires.Regrets.\nIn the prison yard, the governor lectures Pu Yi on the technique of silently urinating into a bucket so as not to wake his cellmates.\nPu Yi turns to look at his former valet, silently beseeching him for support.\nThe man responds by angrily leaving the yard exclaiming, \"You still think I'm a servant, don't you?\"When he's back in his cell, Pu Yi denies that anything has changed.\n\"You are all pretending.\"\nHis cell leader tells him to shut up, that they are working for a new China.\nAs the cell leader summons a guard, Pu Yi is struck by the man's sincerity.\nHe sits on the side of his bed repeatedly muttering, \"I let it happen.\"The Puppet, 1935.\nElizabeth gives birth but the doctor (Jiechen Dong) murders the baby by fatal injection.\nMeanwhile, in an office emblazoned with heroic murals, Amakasu supervises as Henry signs an edict making Japanese the official language in schools.\nAfter the signing, the doctor enters and tells Henry that the baby was born dead.\nRegarding Elizabeth, he prescribes a clinic stay \"somewhere warm.\"\nEastern Jewel enters and informs Henry that Elizabeth has already left.Henry runs to catch the departing Elizabeth but, in a reprise of attempted escapes from the Forbidden City, soldiers close the gates upon his approach.\nFrom a second floor balcony, Amakasu and Eastern Jewel watch the pathetic Henry walk back to the palace.\nThey hold hands, fingers entwined.Consequences.\nThe prisoners are in the prison auditorium.\nA newsreel showing diving Japanese fighter bombers is being aired.\nIt begins with the words \"With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp, the Japanese soon controlled most of North China.\"\nThe newsreel continues to chronicle the Sino-Japanese war commencing in 1937 and the atrocities committed by Japanese forces.\nWhen Pu Yi sees his image in the newsreel, he rises from his seat and remains standing, staring agog as the film goes on to show the piled bodies of the victims of Japanese biological experiments conducted in Manchukuo followed by scenes of opium processing and consumption.Capture, 1945.\nThe sound of Japanese Emperor Hirohito's surrender broadcast in the newsreel takes Pu Yi back in time once again.\nEastern Jewel sits beside a radio.\nShe listens to Hirohito's surrender broadcast as in a trance, but she lurches at the crack of a gunshot.\nAmakasu has shot himself in the left temple.\nHead down, Amakasu's blood spreads across his desk.The Manchukuo palace is being evacuated when Elizabeth returns from exile.\nShe has gone quite mad.\nShe spits in the faces of the Japanese soldiers.\nWhen she reaches Henry she pauses and stares at her husband as though she can't quite figure out who he is.\nShe twitches uncontrollably and then shuffles on aided by her nurse.Henry is being hustled along by Colonel Yoshioka who wants to beat his way out of Manchuria ahead of Russian soldiers, but Henry delays.\nHe turns and follows Elizabeth.\nHe watches as she spits on Amakasu's corpse.\nThen, with eyes glistening, he follows her as she ambles to her bedroom.\nShe pauses at the bedroom door allowing him to approach and then, without looking directly at him, she shivers and goes through the door.\nInside, she turns and vacantly gazes at Henry as she closes the door.\nHenry is left standing outside the door, shattered.\nAt the end of the hallway, Yoshioka is adamant. \"Now!\" he shouts.As the hanger doors are opening, the twin-engine escape plane is warming up.\nColonel Yoshioka, Henry, and Henry's principal ministers are aboard.\nYoshioka hears distant shooting and looks out through the windscreen to see Russian paratroopers floating down to earth.\nThey have been captured.Responsibility.\nThe prison governor leaves his office and enters the compound.\nThe prisoners are scattered throughout the compound playing ping-pong, except for Pu Yi.\nPu Yi is tending his flower garden.\nAs he works the soil, the governor stops and faces him.\nThe governor castigates Pu Yi for admitting to crimes that he couldn't possibly have known about, the biological experiments, for example.\nWhen asked why he signed every accusation hurled against him, Pu Yi breaks his silence and matter-of-factly replies, \"I was responsible for everything.\"\n\"You are responsible for what you do!\" the governor honestly counters.\nHe continues.\n\"All your life you thought you were better than everyone else. Now you think you are the worst of all!\"\nReferring to his suicide attempt in the railroad station, using words fraught with past implications, Pu Yi says, \"You saved my life to make me a puppet in your own play.\"\nHe puts down a watering can, turns, and intently addresses the governor.\n\"You saved me because I am useful to you.\"\nStunned that Pu Yi has come so far without fully appreciating the worth of an ordinary life, the governor asks, \"Is that so terrible, to be useful?\"Reformed, 1959.\nThe prisoners are arrayed as a chorus, singing.\nThey finish the song and sit down.\nA motion picture cameraman is filming.\nThe prison governor is on the stage at a microphone.\nPu Yi's name is called.\nAs he walks toward the stage, Pu Yi hears a prison official read the proclamation that releases him from prison.\nHe is handed the proclamation and, as the governor shakes his hand, he hears the governor say, \"You see? I will end up living in prison longer than you.\"\nThey smile warmly to each other as their handclasp lingers.Freedom, 1967.\nPu Yi leaves the Beijing Botanical Gardens where he works as a gardener.\nHe has been free these past seven years for the first time in his life.\nHe smiles a lot.\nOn his bicycle ride home he stops at an open air market.\nHis brother, Pu Chieh, is there.\nUp the street a large group of young people approach as a parade.\nThey carry banners and pictures of Chairman Mao.\nA twelve piece accordion band leads the way.\nThe young people are chanting and waving little red books.\nThey are Red Guard.\nIn their midst, a group of dunce hatted, revisionist lackeys are being herded along.\nAmong them is Pu Yi's former prison governor!\nPu Yi goes up to him.\nHe tells the nearest Red Guard that there must be a mistake, that this is a good man.\nThe guardsman tells Pu Yi to fuck off.\n\"But what has he done?\" Pu Yi asks.\n\"He's been accused,\" the young man replies.\nThe guardsman turns to face the governor.\n\"Confess your crime,\" he commands.\n\"I have nothing to confess,\" the former prison governor replies.\nPu Yi's former keeper is then repeatedly forced to kowtow.Pu Yi tries to talk to the Red Guard but they frog march him to the side of the street and push him to the ground.\nAs Pu Yi lies on the asphalt, the lackeys are hustled ahead.\nTheir former place on the street is now occupied by a flag waver and a troop of schoolgirls.\nThe schoolgirls march around in a choreographed display while singing a stirring patriotic song.Pu Yi leaves the street and visits the Forbidden City.\nIt is near closing time.\nShadows stretch across the courtyard in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.\nHe enters the building in which he held court so very long ago.\nMagically, he is alone.\nHe looks up at his former throne, then steps over the decorative rope that demarcates the line beyond which the public is not to go.\n\"Stop!\" a small boy cries.\n\"You are not allowed in there!\" the boy shouts as he runs toward Pu Yi.\nWhen the boy asks who he is, Pu Yi replies, \"I was the emperor of China.\"\nWhen asked to prove it, Pu Yi climbs the steps to the throne and recovers a cricket cage.\nHe hands it to the boy.\nThe boy descends the steps and pops the top off the cricket cage.\nHe then turns back as though to ask Pu Yi what it is, but Pu Yi is not there.\nHe has disappeared.\nThe boy runs back up the stairs, looks around, and then stares at the cricket cage he holds.\nAn elderly cricket crawls out and onto the boy's shirt.Heritage, today.\nA tour guide playing a synthesized version of Yankee Doodle Dandy leads a horde of American tourists into the throne room.\nShe explains that this is the room where emperors of China were crowned.\n\"The last emperor to be crowned here was Aisin Gioro Pu Yi,\" she announces. \"He was three years old. He died in 1967.\"Ed. Notes:\nThe film makers slightly altered the time line of Pu Yi's early life.\nRe, The Emperor of China, 1908: Pu Yi was only two years of age when he was invested.\nRe, Brothers, 1914: The wall, from which Pu Chieh points to the president of China and which is clearly under construction, was actually constructed in 1912, thus, Pu Yi would have been only six years of age and his brother would have been five.\nRe, Education, 1919: Pu Yi would have been only thirteen years of age and his brother would have been twelve.\nWan Jung was nicknamed Elizabeth at the American missionary school in Tientsin which she attended as a girl.\nPu Yi was jocularly nicknamed Henry, after Henry VIII and as suggested by Pu Yi's relationship to Elizabeth, by Reginald Johnston.\nPu Yi's Manchu clan name was Aisin Gioro (Gold Clan) but he would not have been called Aisin Gioro Pu Yi as clan names are not used in that manner.\nPu Yi's name is also often spelled \"Puyi\".\nPu Chieh's name is also often spelled \"Pujie\".\nAfter leaving Pu Yi's service in 1924, Reginald Johnston became commissioner of the British Weihaiwei lease located at the end of the strategic Shandong Peninsula until that prefecture was returned to China in the autumn of 1930.\nEastern Jewel (Dongzhen) was the courtesy name for Yu Aixinjueluo (or Xianyu) of the Manchu Aisin Gioro.\nShe was a Qing princess and a distant relative of Pu Yi.\nShe was raised in Japan where she was called Yoshiko Kawashima.\n(Sources: Numerous Wikipedia articles from both English and Chinese sites and the Encyclopedia Britannica.)"}
