{"mid": "MrHublot", "IMDB_id": "tt3043542", "title": "Mr Hublot", "plot": "Mr. Hublot is a man who lives in a tiny apartment located in a crowded steampunk city. He wears several layers of eyewear and has an odometer-like counter in his forehead which runs forward and backward. Mr. Hublot also displays several OCD symptoms, such as turning the lights on and off several times before leaving the living room and meticulously straightening the pictures on his wall.\nMr. Hublot sees a tiny puppy-like robot shivering in a box. When the box is taken away for garbage disposal, Mr. Hublot, concerned for the puppy's welfare, takes the robot to his house.\nThe robot gets bigger and bigger and is soon much bigger than Mr. Hublot. After the creature causes extensive damage to the apartment, Mr. Hublot appears to attack the creature, which seems suddenly frightened, with a screwdriver.\nAfter some time has passed, Mr. Hublot is shown in his home, with everything returned to normal. To the surprise of the audience, it is revealed that, far from destroying the creature, Mr. Hublot has instead moved from his tiny apartment to the warehouse across the street so that he could accommodate his oversized pet. They both seem happy and Mr. Hublot continues to turn the lights on and off before leaving the room."}
