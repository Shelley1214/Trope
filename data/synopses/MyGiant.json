When Sammy wakes up, he thinks he is in Heaven. But, he is confused to find a statue of Jesus next to his bed, as he was raised Jewish. He then realizes Max has brought him to a monastery, where he was raised after being given up for adoption by his parents because of his height.\nOnce he wakes up and interacts with Max, he sees potential stardom in him.

First, Max obtains the role of a villain in a movie, but he is so drunk that he vomits on the protagonist. However, the scene is included in the movie.\nOne day, Sammy talks to Steven Seagal about including Max as a villain in one of his movies, convincing him that he needs a different kind of villain. At first Seagal rejects him because there was another actor who would take that role, but he changes his opinion after listening to an extract of a Shakespearean play done by Max.\nSuddenly, after some medical exams, Max is diagnosed with heart disease which cannot be treated with a transplant because Max' heart is so big. Sammy decides to find Lilliana, and tries to convince her to meet Max again, but she rejects the invitation. Sammy then convinces his wife to take the role of Lilliana and after some words, Max asks her for a kiss.\nAfterwards, Sammy and his wife decide to get back together again, after realizing that they were truly in love and that their son needed them.\nSammy eventually decides to return Max home to Romania. Max refuses to go back, but finally he enters his old house, and meet his parents again, who abandoned him. Sammy ends up watching Max' first filmed scene in a cinema with his family.
