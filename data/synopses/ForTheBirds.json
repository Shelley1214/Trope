{"mid": "ForTheBirds", "IMDB_id": "tt0248808", "title": "For the Birds", "plot": "A flock of small, blue, birds land and sit on a telephone wire together. Two of them start to argue, push each other. Then they all take sides until a huge goofy bird lands on a nearby pole and wants to join them. As this long, lanky, unwanted guest flies over, the wire sags all almost all of the way to the ground. The little birds get angry as they slide down to the bottom point, bumping into him. They knock the big one off with a peck, but he hangs on with on foot. The closest birds peck away at his toes until he lets go, Just before he does, a few of the little birds see what is about to happen, so they chirp about it. It is too late and poof! The little ones get slung high into the air like the wire is a sling shot, and they lose their feathers. As the naked little birds land, bounce and squeak, the hide behind the big one as he laughs."}
