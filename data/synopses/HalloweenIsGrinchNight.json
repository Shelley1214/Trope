{"mid": "HalloweenIsGrinchNight", "IMDB_id": "tt0183288", "title": "Halloween Is Grinch Night", "plot": "In Whoville, on a night known as \"Grinch Night\", which commences when a \"Sour-Sweet Wind\" blows and a chain of events causes the Gree-Grumps and Hakken-Krakks to prompt The Grinch into terrorizing the Whos, as he believes such nights are the perfect nights for a Grinch Night. Later, Euchariah, a polite little Who with a slight astigmatism, goes to use the outhouse (referred to as \"the euphemism\" in the story), but is swept away to Mt. Crumpit by the wind.\nOn the road he encounters the Grinch, who is busy picking Brickles out of his fur after failing to hunt down the \"Wuzzy Woozoo\". Along with the Grinch's dog, Max, who is in the process of bringing a large wagon called the \"Paraphernalia Wagon\" down to Whoville. Euchariah decides to stall the Grinch from reaching Whoville. After some persistence from Euchariah, the Grinch tricks him into getting a strange trance in the Paraphernalia Wagon.\nInside the wagon, Euchariah is confronted by surreal imagery, numerous monsters and the Grinch's mocking voice. Although he is scared out of his wits, Euchariah bravely keeps on his toes long enough for the Sour-Sweet Wind to die down, thus forcing the Grinch to pack up and retire to his cave. Max on the other hand, who had been abused and overworked by the Grinch, goes home with Euchariah. Back in Whoville, the residents (including Euchariah's grandfather Josiah and his grandmother Mariah) celebrate the little Who's courage in preventing the Grinch from releasing the Paraphernalia Wagon's full horrors on their town and up in the mountains the Grinch, who is hauling the wagon home himself, ominously notes that one day there will be another Grinch Night when the Sour-Sweet Wind blows once more."}
