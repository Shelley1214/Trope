{"mid": "SavingChristmas", "IMDB_id": "tt4009460", "title": "Saving Christmas", "plot": "The film starts with Cameron sitting on a chair by a fireplace and talking directly to the audience, telling them of his love of Christmas but saying the traditional Christmas imagery is \"all wrong\" and having \"nothing to do with Christmas\", and blaming atheists for trying to take the holiday away from Christians; he also suggests that Santa Claus is a Christian.\nKirk goes to a Christmas party at the house of his sister (played by Cameron's real-life sister Bridgette Ridenour). While there he notices that his brother-in-law, Christian, isn't celebrating like the others. When asked why he seems so sad, Christian says he feels the holiday became too commercialized and consumerist. Kirk tells Christian that he is wrong and starts reminding him of the stories of the Bible. Meanwhile, two guests at the party discuss conspiracy theories.\nAs Christian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Kirk tells him that Christmas trees were God's idea, since he made the trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross, and suggests the audience to see a cross each time they see a tree. Kirk's brother-in-law is convinced by his arguments, but then starts complaining about Santa Claus for he sees him as an obliteration of Jesus and noticed that \"Santa\" and \"Satan\" have the same letters, but Kirk tells him that the original Santa Claus (before being re-interpreted by western culture) was actually Saint Nicholas beating up non-believers and people who did not believe enough, thus making Santa a good religious figure; his brother-in-law is now convinced that \"Santa is the man\".\nChristian is now convinced of Christmas' faithfulness to its religious roots, and the two return to the party. Kirk then explains that the presents at Christmas represent Jerusalem, and that Christmas is \"doing what God does\", as he always gave humanity many gifts. He then suggests once more to bring back Christianity in Christmas for our children. His brother-in-law, as a gift for his wife, organizes the same night a hip-hop dance representing his joy of celebrating Christmas, leading to everyone dancing and partying together. Kirk then tells everyone to feast, and suggests the audience organize the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget this is a celebration of God."}
