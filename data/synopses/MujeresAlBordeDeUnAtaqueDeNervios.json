{"mid": "MujeresAlBordeDeUnAtaqueDeNervios", "IMDB_id": "tt0095675", "title": "Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios", "plot": "The film plot takes its starting point from the French play The Human Voice (La Voix humaine, 1930) by Jean Cocteau where a desperate woman tries to avoid being dumped by her lover through a series of phone calls. In the film TV actress Pepa Marcos (Carmen Maura) is depressed and taking sleeping pills because her boyfriend Iv\u00e1n (Fernando Guill\u00e9n) has just left her. Both she and Iv\u00e1n work as voice-over actors who dub foreign films, notably Johnny Guitar with Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later.\nPepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela (Mar\u00eda Barranco). In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos (Antonio Banderas), Iv\u00e1n's son with previous lover Luc\u00eda (Julieta Serrano), arrives with his snobby fianc\u00e9e, Marisa (Rossy de Palma). It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\nMeanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some gazpacho she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while back she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver.\nHowever, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv\u00e1n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to Stockholm that evening and divert it to Beirut, where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc\u00eda calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos reveals that Luc\u00eda has been in a mental hospital since Iv\u00e1n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv\u00e1n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv\u00e1n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv\u00e1n, who has arrived with Paulina (Kiti Manver) on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message.\nPepa returns to her apartment she hears the song from the opening, \"Soy Infeliz\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the record and throws it out the window, which ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv\u00e1n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc\u00eda arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The cops and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and crazy Luc\u00eda grabs the cops' guns and aims them at Pepa. Pepa figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver.\nPepa chases her and is joined by Ana, the motorcyclist's angry girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (it turns out that it is the Mambo taxi again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc\u00eda firing the gun at them. Luc\u00eda arrives at the airport, sees that Iv\u00e1n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda. Iv\u00e1n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv\u00e1n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late.\" Having saved his life, she leaves the airport, and Iv\u00e1n, for good.\nPepa returns to her home, which is a mess with a burnt bedroom, broken windows, a telephone ripped off the wall, spilled gazpacho on the floor, her collection of animals running around loose, and several unconscious visitors all overdosed on sleeping pills. Pepa sits on her balcony where Marisa has just woken up. The two women share a moment of tranquility at the end of a crazy 48 hours, and Pepa finally reveals what her big news for Iv\u00e1n was: she's pregnant."}
