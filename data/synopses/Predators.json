{"mid": "Predators", "IMDB_id": "tt1424381", "title": "Predators", "plot": "Royce awakens to find himself parachuting into an unfamiliar jungle. He meets several others who arrived in the same manner: Mexican drug cartel enforcer Cuchillo, Spetsnaz soldier Nikolai, Israel Defense Forces sniper Isabelle, Revolutionary United Front officer Mombasa, San Quentin death row inmate Stans, Yakuza enforcer Hanzo and general practice doctor Edwin.\nUpon landing, they discover that all are armed and lethal killers, with the apparent exception of Edwin, though none know where they are or how they got there. The group follows Royce, who Isabelle suspects is a former black operations soldier turned mercenary. In the jungle they find empty cages, plants with a neurotoxic poison that Edwin collects on a scalpel, and a deceased US Special Forces soldier. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize that they are not on Earth.\nThe party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is then used as bait to lure the survivors into a trap, but they avoid it. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a game preserve, where humans are hunted as game. The group follows the quadrupeds' tracks to a camp and finds a captive Predator. The \"hunters\", three larger Predators known as the Tracker, Berserker and Falconer, attack the group. Mombasa is killed and the rest of the group escapes. Royce confronts Isabelle, believing she knows something about the creatures based on her shock of recognition when they encountered the alien. She reveals that she has heard of the Predators before, from a report by the only survivor (Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer) of a Special Forces team who encountered one twenty three years earlier in Guatemala.\nThe group next meets Noland, a lone soldier who has survived on the planet for \"ten seasons\" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims. At his hideout, he explains that the Predators hunt in threes and sharpen their killing skills by abducting warriors and dangerous beasts from other worlds and bringing them to the planet to hunt. Noland also reveals that there is a blood feud between the larger Predators and the smaller ones. Royce hopes that if the group can free the smaller Predator being held prisoner in the encampment, it may take them home using the other Predators' spaceship.\nWhen the group fall asleep, Noland traps them in a room and attempts to use smoke to suffocate them. Having gone mad, he plans to kill them for their equipment and supplies. Royce uses an explosive to break out of the room, attracting the Predators to the hideout. Noland tries to escape and is killed by a Predator. In the ensuing chase, Nikolai uses two claymores to kill The Tracker Predator, sacrificing himself. Stans savagely attacks leader known as the Berserker with his shiv, buying time for the others to escape, and is killed when the Predator rips out his skull and spine. Hanzo duels The Falconer Predator with a katana, killing it before falling down from his wounds.\nHoping they can commandeer a spacecraft to return them to Earth, Royce, Isabelle and Edwin head for the Predators' camp until Edwin is injured by a trap. When Isabelle refuses to abandon him, Royce leaves them both behind and they are caught by the Berserker. Royce frees the smaller Predator in exchange for control of its ship and leaves as the two Predators confront each other. The Berserker kills the smaller one and destroys the ship as it takes off. Meanwhile, Edwin paralyzes Isabelle with the neurotoxic poison on his scalpel and reveals that on Earth he was a murderer, and feels that he fits in on this planet among the monsters. Royce appears, never having boarded the ship, and stabs Edwin with his own scalpel, paralyzing him.\nRoyce booby-traps Edwin with grenades, using him as bait to injure the remaining Predator. While Isabelle covers him with her sniper rifle, he proceeds to fight the Berserker with an axe and eventually decapitates it. As Royce and Isabelle rest, they observe parachutes opening in the distant sky. Royce, surmising that more Predators will soon arrive to hunt the new prey, tells Isabelle they must find another way to get off the planet, and they make their way back towards the jungle."}
