Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris\u2019s writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.\nAfter the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book\u2019s pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of Humpty Dumpty, who urges Morris to follow him.\nThe flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.\nMorris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne\u2019s From the Earth to the Moon after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf. He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.\nYears later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life\u2019s work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris\u2019s portrait added to the picture wall in the library."}
