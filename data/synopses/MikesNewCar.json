{"mid": "MikesNewCar", "IMDB_id": "tt0323250", "title": "Mike's New Car", "plot": "Mike is obsessed with his new six-wheel drive car, and insists on showing it off to Sulley. Unfortunately for Mike, anything that can go wrong does go wrong. Sulley plays with the adjustable power seat until an annoyed Mike asks him to stop. Mike starts the engine and hears the seatbelt reminder tone sound off.\nAlthough Sulley manages to get his seatbelt on easily, Mike finds his seatbelt stuck and accidentally locks himself out of the car while trying to unstick it. Mike tells Sulley to push a button, but confused by the massive amount of buttons on the dashboard, he pushes a button that pops the hood open. When Mike goes over to close it, he is unable to reach it. Sulley helps Mike close the hood but accidentally closes on Mike's fingers, causing Mike to scream, Sulley helps Mike get free but ends up trapping him in the engine compartment.\nSulley opens the hood, Mike manages to escape, re-enters the car, and is exasperated by the continuous seatbelt reminder tone. Mike manages to put his seat-belt on, but the windshield wipers get turned on, much to his frustration. As Sulley tries to help, Mike tells him not to touch anything and decides to do it himself. Mike pushes a button that launches the entire car into chaotic malfunction, including Latin conga music playing loudly on the car's stereo system.\nMike finally ends the chaos by pulling the key out of the ignition, but then Sulley accidentally breaks the rearview mirror in an attempt to realign it. Mike gets angry, forces Sulley out of the car, and speeds away, wrecking the car completely. Sulley mutters, \"Huh, that's weird, the airbag didn't go off.\" Right on cue, the airbag inflates, and its force sends Mike flying back up the street. Sulley catches Mike, who mourns for his old car before agreeing to walk to work while the credits roll."}
