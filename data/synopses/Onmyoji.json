{"mid": "Onmyoji", "IMDB_id": "tt0355857", "title": "Onmyoji", "plot": "At the construction of a new capital of Japan, Heian, a ceremony is performed to prevent the attacks of the vengeful spirit of Prince Sawara, who had been wrongfully accused of committing treason and put to death. An official announces the construction of a holy barrier that will trap Prince Sawara's spirit and prevent it from haunting the capital. 150 years later, the Onmyoji are responsible for controlling the supernatural phenomena within the city. Court onmyoji Abe no Seimei is a talented onmyoji with skills that surpass the head court onmyoji Doson, who schemes to overthrow the emperor and claim the throne for himself. Seimei meets and takes a liking into Minamoto no Hiromasa, a court swordsman who has little understanding but is mesmerized by the onmyojis and their work. The current emperor is anxious for an heir. One of his wives gives birth to a prince, resulting in his other wife, Lady Ayako, losing his favor. Doson takes advantage of this situation and curses the newborn prince with a demon and casts a spell to turn Lady Ayako into a demon. Seimei combats these spells with the help of the immortal Lady Aone, who was Prince Sawara's lover. Doson summons Sawara and absorbs his spirit to conquer the capital. During his invasion of the capital, Doson kills Hiromasa. Aone offers to sacrifice her immortality and revive Hiromasa by exchanging their lives. She does so because Hiromasa and Seimei are foretold in the stars to be the protectors of the city. Later, Aone's spirit quells Sawara's angered spirit, and Seimei subsequently defeats Doson with an act of wit."}
