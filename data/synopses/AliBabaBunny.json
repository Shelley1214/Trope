{"mid": "AliBabaBunny", "IMDB_id": "tt0050111", "title": "Ali Baba Bunny", "plot": "In the middle of the Arabian Desert, a rich Sultan has stored all his treasure in a cave and is leaving his guard Hassan to watch the cave. As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door (\"Open Sesame\").\nInside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about travelling underground (\"What a way for a duck to travel; underground!\") and that they're at the wrong place are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow.\nMeanwhile, Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Mistaking Hassan for a \"redcap\" (porter), Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy chuckles nervously before he flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy.\nHassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself.\nOutside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly, Daffy runs out of the cave carrying a large gem. Hassan is in hot pursuit, enraged over the duck's efforts to lay claim to the treasure. Daffy begs Bugs to save him, and Bugs reluctantly complies while berating Daffy for his greed. He sets up an Indian rope trick behind a rock, and misleads Hassan up the rope. As Hassan disappears into the clouds, Bugs pulls the rope down. With the coast clear, Daffy runs back into the cave to enjoy the treasure.\nSome time later, Daffy has emptied the cave of treasure into an enormous cart. Looking back, he spots an old oil lamp and rubs the dust off it. A genie comes out of the lamp, but Daffy thinks he is after the treasure and proceeds to stomp him back into the lamp. The genie reemerges from the lamp in a fury, declaring Daffy will suffer the 'consequences' for his disrespect, and Bugs, unable (and unwilling) to save Daffy, hurriedly escapes via burrow. Daffy, however, dismisses his punishment, just as the genie zaps him with bolts of magic.\nMuch later, Bugs has finally made it to Pismo Beach and, while tucking into the area's famous clams, casually wonders how Daffy's encounter with the genie worked out. Opening one clam and discovering a pearl inside, he soon finds out; Daffy, shrunk to a few inches in height, emerges from Bugs' burrow trail in the sand and claims the pearl for his own. Bugs closes the clam on the greedy duck by saying \"Oh, brother. Close sesame!\""}
