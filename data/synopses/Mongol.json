{"mid": "Mongol", "IMDB_id": "tt0416044", "title": "Mongol", "plot": "The story starts in 1192 (\"Year of the Black Rat\") with Tem\u00fcjin (Tadanobu Asano) as a prisoner in the Tangut kingdom. He conveys his memories about his earlier life through a series of flashbacks.\nIn the first flashback, embarking on an expedition as a young boy (age 9) twenty years earlier (1172), Tem\u00fcjin (Odnyam Odsuren) is accompanied by his father Yes\u00fcgei (Ba Sen) to select a girl as his future wife. Tem\u00fcjin meets and chooses B\u00f6rte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat), although his father wishes him to choose a mate from the Merkit tribe. Tem\u00fcjin convinces his father to allow him to choose B\u00f6rte. He promises to return after five years to marry her. On their way home, Tem\u00fcjin's father is poisoned by an enemy tribe. As he lies dying, he tells Tem\u00fcjin that he is now Khan. However, one of his father's warriors, Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov), orders the other tribesmen to loot the dead Khan's camp. Targutai spares Tem\u00fcjin's life, declaring a Mongol does not kill children. After falling through the ice of a frozen lake, Tem\u00fcjin is found lying down in the snow by a young boy called Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvshinbayar). The two quickly become friends and perform a traditional ceremony declaring themselves blood brothers. Targutai later captures Tem\u00fcjin, holding him in captivity. Tem\u00fcjin however, escapes late one night and roams the countryside. Tem\u00fcjin is later seen again as a young man (Tadanobu Asano) in 1186. He once again is apprehended by Targutai, who wishes to kill him now that he is grown. Tem\u00fcjin escapes a second time finding B\u00f6rte (Chuluuny Khulan), and brings her back to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the Merkit tribe led by Chiledu (Sai Xing Ga), since Tem\u00fcjin's father had years before stolen his wife from one of their tribesmen. While being chased on horseback, Tem\u00fcjin is shot with an arrow. B\u00f6rte whips the horse which Tem\u00fcjin is on, telling it to go home. B\u00f6rte is captured by the Merkit leader, as Tem\u00fcjin returns safely to his family.\nTem\u00fcjin goes to Jamukha (Sun Honglei), who is now a Khan himself. Jamukha agrees to help him get his wife back and attack the Merkit tribe, though only after a year passes. The attack on the Merkit tribe is a success, and Tem\u00fcjin finds B\u00f6rte alive and Chiledu dead. However, B\u00f6rte is pregnant. Despite knowing that he is not the father, Tem\u00fcjin takes the son as his own. Tem\u00fcjin and his men leave early the next morning, and two of Jamukha's soldiers choose to join Tem\u00fcjin because he distributes more plunder to his warriors than Jamukha. Jamukha chases down Tem\u00fcjin, but Tem\u00fcjin refuses to send back Jamukha's combatants and horses because he explains a Mongol warrior is free to choose his leader. Jamukha warns him that his actions will lead to future conflict. Taichar (Bu Ren), Jamukha's brother, is later killed while attempting to steal back Jamukha's horses; Jamukha and Tem\u00fcjin go to war. Outnumbered, Tem\u00fcjin's army is quickly defeated. Jamukha declares victory and decides to make Tem\u00fcjin a slave rather than execute him.\nTem\u00fcjin is sold to a Tangut Garrison Chief (Zhang Jiong), despite the dire warning given to the man by a Buddhist monk (Ben Hon Sun) acting as his advisor, who senses the great potential the warrior carries and his future role in subjugating the Tangut state. While Tem\u00fcjin is imprisoned, the monk pleads with him to spare his monastery when he destroys the Tangut kingdom sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to B\u00f6rte indicating that he is still alive, Tem\u00fcjin agrees. Thereafter, the monk succeeds in delivering the bone and the message, though at the cost of his life. As a means of getting to Tangut, B\u00f6rte becomes a merchant's concubine, bearing a daughter along the way. Once B\u00f6rte arrives in Tangut, she abandons the merchant and bribes the guard for the key to Tem\u00fcjin's cell, and the two manage to escape back to their homeland.\nTem\u00fcjin, upset by the increasing loss of traditional values in Mongol society, leaves his family once more and pledges to make the Mongols abide by the law. Visiting a holy site in the mountains, Tem\u00fcjin prays to \"The Lord of the Great Blue Sky\" and declares three rules by which Mongols must live: never kill women and children, always honor your promises and repay your debts, and never betray your Khan. Subsequently, he gathers an army to unify all of the Mongols. In 1196, Tem\u00fcjin declares war over Jamukha. By 1206, Tem\u00fcjin engages Jamukha, in league with his old enemy, Targutai, in battle. However, a thunderstorm arises on the steppe, terrifying Jamukha's troops and causing their unconditional surrender, as Tem\u00fcjin stands triumphant (as he is the only Mongol alive who does not fear lightning). Having defeated his \"blood brother\", Tem\u00fcjin allows Jamukha to live, while Targutai is killed by his own soldiers while attempting to flee the battle. The traitorous men are ordered to be executed by Tem\u00fcjin (as they betrayed their Khan). Jamukha's surviving troops are spared and integrated into Temujin's army. Afterwards, Tem\u00fcjin is designated the Khan of all the Mongols \u2013 Genghis Khan of the Great Steppe.\nA postscript indicates that Genghis Khan would later go on to invade and conquer the Tangut Empire by 1227, fulfilling the monk's prophecy. While the entire civilization was destroyed by the Mongol horde, a single Buddhist monastery was left untouched, as Tem\u00fcjin honored his debt to the monk."}
