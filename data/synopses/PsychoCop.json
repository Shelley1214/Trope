Upon noticing the caretaker's disappearance, the couples go looking for him, and encounter Vickers, who reassures them by claiming that the caretaker had an accident, and is now recovering in the hospital. That night, Zack leaves to get beer, and is slain by Vickers.\nVickers proceeds to butcher Eric, Julie, and Sarah. Doug and Laura realize that Vickers is the culprit, and are chased into the forest, where they are found by a pair of policemen, Chris and Bradley. Before being killed by Vickers, the officers reveal that he is really Gary Henley, a discharged psychiatric patient who has somehow infiltrated the California Police Department.\nLaura is pursued by Vickers to a clearing containing the crucified bodies of Zack, Julie, Eric, and Sarah. Laura shoots Vickers with his own sidearm, but he is unaffected, only being felled when he has a sharp log thrown through him by Doug. Emergency services greet Laura and Doug at the mansion as Vickers recovers, and a newscast announces that further evidence indicates that he is actually an escaped psychopathic serial killer named Ted Warnicky."}
