{"mid": "Tampopo", "IMDB_id": "tt0092048", "title": "Tampopo", "plot": "A pair of truck drivers, the experienced Gor\u014d and a younger sidekick named Gun, stop at a decrepit roadside ramen noodle shop. Outside, Gor\u014d rescues a boy who is being beaten up by three schoolmates. The boy, Tabo, turns out to be the son of Tampopo, the widowed owner of the struggling business, Lai Lai. When a customer called Pisken harasses Tampopo, Gor\u014d invites him and his men to step outside. Gor\u014d puts up a good fight, but outnumbered by Pisken and his men, he is knocked out and wakes up the next morning in Tampopo's home.\nWhen Tampopo asks their opinion of her noodles, Gor\u014d and Gun tell her they are \"sincere, but lack character.\" After Gor\u014d gives her some advice, she asks him to become her teacher. They decide to turn her establishment into a paragon of the \"art of noodle soup making\". Gor\u014d takes her around and points out the strengths and weaknesses of her competitors. She still cannot get the broth just right, so Gor\u014d brings in the \"old master\" and his superlative expertise. When they rescue a wealthy elderly man from choking on his food, he lends her his chauffeur Shohei, who has a masterful way with noodles. Also, through clever trickery they pry ramen secrets from their competitors. During the transition, the group agrees to change the restaurant's name from \"Lai Lai\" to \"Tampopo\".\nPisken feels bad for being too drunk to tell his men to stay out of the fight, so he offers Gor\u014d another chance one-on-one. After the rematch ends in a draw, Pisken reveals he is a contractor and offers to make over the shop's interior. Tampopo's latest effort still comes up short, so Pisken teaches her his own secret recipe. When the five men consume her latest creation down to the last drop, Tampopo knows she has won. (Tabo also triumphs, beating all three of his tormentors). As customers fill her newly redecorated shop, the men file out one by one.\nThe main narrative is interspersed with stories involving food on several levels. Satirical vignettes involve a lowly worker who upstages his superiors by displaying his vast culinary knowledge while ordering at a gourmet French restaurant; a housewife who rises from her deathbed to cook one last meal for her family; and a women's etiquette class on how to eat spaghetti properly. Another subplot involves a corner store clerk who has to deal with an older woman obsessed with squeezing food. The clerk's scene segues into a restaurant involving an investment scam and the intended victim, who turns out to be a conman himself.\nThe primary subplot involves a young man in a white suit \u2013 an elegant gangster \u2013 and his lover, who explore erotic ways to use food. In the end, the man is shot several times by an unknown assailant, to his lover's horror, but uses his last words to convey his secret recipe for sausages.\nThroughout, the film puns off stereotypical American movie themes, characters, music and camera set-ups and shots."}
