{"mid": "CityOfAngels", "IMDB_id": "tt0120632", "title": "City of Angels", "plot": "Wayne Rogers plays a determined but unethical private detective, Jake Axminster, who looks out for himself\u2014and somewhat less aggressively for his clients\u2014amid the corruption of Los Angeles, California, in the mid-1930s. He is aided in his investigative efforts by two friends: his ditzy blonde secretary, Marsha Finch (Elaine Joyce), who also runs a call-girl business on the side, and attorney Michael Brimm (Philip Sterling). Brimm is called upon frequently to defend Axminster from charges (mostly trumped-up) leveled against him by Lieutenant Murray Quint (Clifton James), a fat, cigar-chomping, and thoroughly crooked member of the Los Angeles Police Department.\nAxminster drives a 1934 ragtop Studebaker and keeps his office in downtown L.A.\u2019s historic Bradbury Building, phone number OXford-8704. (Brimm\u2019s office is across the hall.) For his services, Axminster charges $25 a day plus expenses. Although Brimm describes him as \u201cMr. Play-It-Safe,\u201d Axminster regularly places himself in danger by helping friends and annoying the police with his questions. His efforts frequently result in his being beaten up. So often does Quint order his thrashing, that Axminster has taken to having nude photographs shot of himself in order to prove later on how aggressive the cops were in their interrogations.\nThe detective drinks coffee addictively. When one client asks him whether his habit keeps him up, Axminster responds, \u201cNo, but it helps.\u201d He appears to be constantly in debt, and he\u2019s not above borrowing money from friends and even his bootblack, Lester (Timmie Rogers). Axminster \u201cgripes in general about the cost of staying alive. \u2018All the angels left this burg about 20 years ago,\u2019 is his succinct summation of the 1930s ...\u201d"}
