After Manuel fails to catch Speedy, Jose informs Manuel that Speedy is \"the fastest mouse in all Mexico\" and that they will have to use their brains, not their feet, to catch him. The pair set off for Speedy's home in Guadalajara where they again fail to capture him. During their struggles, Manuel gets hit on the head by Jose with a guitar, Jose hooks Speedy with a fishing line and gets towed to Los Angeles, Manuel gets blown up by dynamite, and both cats get blown up in a minefield they constructed. Jose and Manuel are sitting on top of a wall after failing to outsmart and catch Speedy. Manuel laments they should have gone after Speedy's cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez, the \"slowest mouse in all Mexico\". Jose is convinced to go after him and runs off. Manuel desperately tries to catch up to warn him about Slowpoke. No sooner than Jose arrives at the mouse house and catches him, Slowpoke shoots him. Manuel finally catches up and tells Jose exactly what he was trying to warn him about Slowpoke: \"He packs a gun\". Slowpoke blows steam off his gun and returns to his mouse hole, leaving the charred Jose to lament, \"Now he tell me.\""}
