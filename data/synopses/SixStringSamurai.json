{"mid": "SixStringSamurai", "IMDB_id": "tt0118736", "title": "Six-String Samurai", "plot": "In 1957, the Soviet Union attacks the United States with nuclear weapons, rendering most of the nation uninhabitable. The American government has collapsed with the exception of the haven known as \"Lost Vegas\", ruled by King Elvis. The Red Army has been besieging Lost Vegas, but the lack of supplies over the years has relegated them to a gang of thugs. Forty years after the Soviet invasion, King Elvis dies and radio disc jockey Keith Mortimer announces a call for all musicians to come to Lost Vegas to try to become the new King of Rock 'n' Roll.\nBuddy, a lone guitarist and swordsman, saves an unnamed boy he simply calls \"Kid\" from a group of bandits; consequently, as the Kid's mother was killed by the bandits, he tags along with Buddy. As the duo travel through the desert wasteland, the heavy metal-playing Death stages several attempts to prevent Buddy from reaching Lost Vegas alive and claim the throne for himself. After enduring a host of opponents such as a bounty-hunting bowling team, a cannibalistic suburban family, a band of underground mutants, and the Red Army, an injured Buddy squares off against Death in a sword fight. Death mortally wounds Buddy, but the Kid discovers water is Death's weakness after spitting at him. The Kid then melts Death away with a canteen full of water. Buddy's lifeless body disappears, but the Kid puts on his clothes and glasses before continuing his journey toward Lost Vegas."}
