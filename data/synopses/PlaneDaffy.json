{"mid": "PlaneDaffy", "IMDB_id": "tt0037180", "title": "Plane Daffy", "plot": "One after another of a company of carrier pigeons fall prey to the seductive wiles of \"Queen of the Spies\": Hatta Mari. The alarm is raised at pigeon headquarters when Pigeon 13 (a Mortimer Snerd-esque yokel similar to Beaky Buzzard) goes AWOL with the female Nazi spy bird. He reveals all his secrets (after she slipped him a mickey). In shame, Pigeon 13 departs to commit suicide, although after an off-screen gunshot is heard, he briefly returns to note \"I missed.\"\nLater, self-described woman-hater Daffy Duck volunteers for the next mission. Hatta tries to seduce him by hiking up her skirt to reveal her shapely leg and kissing him full on the lips twice. The first kiss electrocutes Daffy and melts him like butter, but the second kiss electrocutes Hatta Mari having the same effect on her. Daffy ultimately resists her charms, but swallows his secret message when the temptress corners him. After a frenetic battle, she x-rays Daffy and broadcasts the supposed secret (\"Hitler is a stinker\") to Hitler himself. Outraged, Hitler declares \"Dat ist no military secret!\" Goebbels and G\u00f6ring concur -- \"Ja. Everybody knows dat!\"\u2014then shoot themselves in the heads after receiving Hitler\u2019s angry glare. Daffy Duck then concludes the cartoon by saying \"They lose more darn \u2018Nutzis\u2019 that way,\" and then going into one of his famous bouncing fits whooping."}
