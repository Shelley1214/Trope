{"mid": "Xxy", "IMDB_id": "tt0995829", "title": "XXY", "plot": "Alex Kraken is a 15-year-old intersex person, with both male and female genitals, who has been living as a girl and using medicines to suppress masculine features, such as a beard, and to attempt to have more feminine features. However, recently Alex has stopped taking her medication.\nAlex's parents moved with her from Argentina to a village by the sea in Uruguay, to avoid the city society's discriminatory views. Her father, N\u00e9stor Kraken, is a marine biologist who has written a book on sexuality and makes a living treating wounded animals found by fishermen. Her mother, Suli, invites friends from Argentina: a surgeon, his wife and teenage son \u00c1lvaro. The purpose, unknown to N\u00e9stor and Alex, is to discuss the possibilities of sex reassignment surgery, of which Suli hopes Alex will be female as per her wishes to her birth.\nAlex directly tells \u00c1lvaro that she would like to have sex with him. Alex seduces \u00c1lvaro and begins to have anal intercourse with him (with her as the penetrative partner). \u00c1lvaro is surprised, but does not stop Alex; however Nestor catches sight of them through the door and Alvaro rushes out feeling conflicted and still in a panic at the unexpected reversal in sexual roles. When Alex later apologizes, \u00c1lvaro reveals that he liked it.\nLater, three curious boys from the village sexually assault Alex by forcibly pulling down her pants to see her genitals. N\u00e9stor realizes that reporting this to the police would cause the whole village to know about Alex's condition. However, Alex decides that it does not matter. Alex also decides that she does not want to resume taking medicines or have an operation. She says, \"What if there is nothing to choose?\""}
