{"mid": "BeforeSunset", "IMDB_id": "tt0381681", "title": "Before Sunset", "plot": "Nine years before, Jesse and C\u00e9line had met and had a brief encounter in Vienna. Jesse's new novel, This Time, was inspired by that night, and becomes a bestseller. He does a book tour in Europe, including Paris. He does a reading at the noted bookstore, Shakespeare and Company. Flashbacks express elements of his time with C\u00e9line in Vienna. Three journalists attend the reading to interview Jesse: one is convinced the book's main characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. As Jesse speaks with the audience, his eyes wander and he sees C\u00e9line there, smiling at him.\nAfter the presentation, the bookstore manager reminds Jesse of his need to leave for the airport in about an hour for his plane. C\u00e9line and Jesse's time together is again constrained. They make the best of it, and their conversations become deeply personal. They begin with themes of work and politics and, with increasing passion, approach their earlier feelings for each other.\nThey touch on their failure to have met as planned six months after their first encounter. Jesse returned to Vienna but C\u00e9line did not, because her grandmother had died suddenly. Since the pair had never exchanged addresses, they had no way to contact each other at the time.\nTheir talk reveals how their lives have changed during the nine years they spent apart. Jesse, now a writer, is married and has a son. C\u00e9line has become an advocate for the environment, and has a photojournalist boyfriend. They each express some dissatisfaction with their lives.\nThey talk as they walk in Paris, with scenes showing a caf\u00e9, garden, bateau mouche, and Jesse's hired car. Their former feelings are slowly rekindled, as their one night together looms large in memory, unmarred by ordinary trials. Jesse says his book was inspired by his hope of seeing C\u00e9line again. She says that it brought back painful memories. They begin to approach each other tentatively but pull back.\nIn the concluding scene, C\u00e9line and Jesse arrive at her apartment. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar. Her song is about their earlier brief encounter. Jesse puts a Nina Simone CD on the stereo system. C\u00e9line dances to the song, \"Just in Time,\" as Jesse watches her. C\u00e9line imitates Simone, saying, \"Baby ... you are gonna miss that plane.\" Jesse smiles and says, \"I know.\""}
