{"mid": "DaddyLongLegs", "IMDB_id": "tt0047969", "title": "Daddy Long Legs", "plot": "A police offiL\ncer finds a baby in a trash can, and Mrs. Lippett, the cruel matron at an orphanage where children are made to work, names her \"Jerusha Abbott\" (she picks \"Abbott\" out of a phone book and gets \"Jerusha\" from a tombstone). The orphan, who comes to be called Judy, does what she can to stand up for the younger children, frequently clashing with both Mrs. Lippett and the cold hearted trustees. At one point she leads a rebellion against being served prunes with every meal and at another, steals a doll from a selfish rich girl to lend to a dying orphan.\nYears later, wealthy Jervis Pendleton, a mysterious benefactor, pays to send Judy, now the oldest and most talented child in the orphanage, to college. He insists, however, that Judy must never try to contact him in person. Judy calls him \"Daddy-Long-Legs,\" and writes to him, however. Judy proves popular with her wealthier and more \"aristocratic\" classmates, and writes a successful book to repay \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" the money he spent on her. She is generally happy but misses not having any real family members to take pride in her accomplishments. Judy also finds herself caught up in a romantic triangle with the older brother of a classmate and an older man (who is, unknown to her, her mysterious benefactor). She eventually chooses the older suitor and is delighted to learn that he is her \"Daddy-Long-Legs.\""}
