The son fails and is torn in two, while the hunter shoots the werewolf, and Tony as he begins the transform.

Providing all eighteen with a victim would bring about the \"voodoo end of the world, when the dead shall rise, and consume all things\".On the advice of Sir Wilfred, Mark and Sarah enter the waxwork at night and douse the museum with gasoline. However, Sarah is lured into the display of the Marquis de Sade, and Mark is pushed into a zombie display by the waxwork's two butlers.
