For the next ten years, Danielle (Drew Barrymore) acts as a household servant as the Baroness mismanages the estate into disrepair.\nWhile working outside early one morning, Danielle attempts to stop a man from stealing one of her family's horses. This man turns out to be Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), attempting to flee his royal responsibilities and an arranged marriage. He buys Danielle's silence with gold and continues to flee only to have his escape foiled when he chooses to assist a caravan being robbed by gypsies. The Royal Guard arrives, helps the caravan, and returns Henry to the Palace.\nDanielle uses the gold from the prince to disguise herself as nobility and buy back a long-term family servant sold by the Baroness to pay her debts.
