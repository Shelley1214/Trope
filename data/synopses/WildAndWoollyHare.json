{"mid": "WildAndWoollyHare", "IMDB_id": "tt0053444", "title": "Wild and Woolly Hare", "plot": "The short opens in the town of Canasta Flats in 1889 and the camera pulls past the Last Chance Saloon and the Next To The Last Chance Saloon and pulls into the Fat Chance Saloon, where the patrons are hanging out. A mustached cowboy tells his friend that he hears that Yosemite Sam is in town, to which his friend makes up an excuse about leaving a cake in the oven and flees.\nSam enters the saloon and states who he is, until he gets interrupted by a voice yelling \"Eh, shut up!\" Sam comes up to the pink shirt cowboy who stayed and demands to know if he just told him to shut up. The cowboy reveals himself to be Bugs Bunny, who admits he indeed told Sam to shut up. When Sam tells Bugs that his backtalk has led him to a duel, Bugs simply comments on Sam's bad breath. Sam then warns Bugs he will get shot and that he's a sharp shooter. Bugs, however, informs Sam he's a sharp shooter as well. To prove it, he tells Sam a shot he's good at, and fires a bullet that ricochet's off various objects before parting Sam's hair down the middle. After Sam sees the bullet come in, he ducks and tells Bugs he missed, but when Bugs tells him to wait, Sam's hat falls off in half, revealing parted hair.\nUnimpressed at this skill of sharp shooting, Sam shows Bugs some real shooting by tossing a can in the air and shooting it full of holes. To top it, Bugs tosses the same can up, but shoots Sam in the face instead. (Some versions depict Bugs firing bullets through the holes in the can instead of shooting Sam.) When Sam threatens to blast Bugs for that \"accident,\" Bugs suggests that they settle things \"in a gentleman-like manner\", to which Sam agrees to, even though it's against his principles.\nThey begin the typical ten-pace and fire, only with Bugs going the same way Sam does, when Sam cheats in the count (\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10!\"). Sam turns to fire, but fires directly past Bugs, who then kisses him on the nose. After Bugs does it again, Sam calls off the \"Gentlemen's Duel\" and forces Bugs to fight \"dirty\", so they each go to opposite ends of a bar shooting at each other. As Sam goes to one end, Bugs blasts him in the face, and when Sam tries to return, Bugs outruns and blasts him again. Unfortunately, their fight is interrupted when Sam hears a train whistle. Seeing that it's 5:15, Sam tells Bugs that he's cutting the gunfight short so that he can catch and rob the train.\nJust as Sam hops aboard his horse and rides off after the train, Bugs follows on another horse. Sam orders Bugs at gunpoint to go back so he can rob the train, but Bugs vows that he's going to save the train. Right after Bugs hops aboard the engine's cab of the train, and switches his cowboy hat with a train engineer's cap, Sam orders Bugs back at the count of five. Just as Sam reaches four, his horse makes him hit a telegraph pole. When Sam catches up again and tries counting to three, but when he gets to two, he runs into the wall of a tunnel. He catches up again and tries just counting two, but when he reaches two, he and his horse fall off a trestle bridge and into a river below.\nSam, however, rides on ahead of Bugs and boards another locomotive to hit Bugs' green-painted 4-4-0 American type steam engine with a tender (#791). Thinking this will make Bugs stop, Sam calls out to Bugs to stop his train because he's got one of his own (a tender-less 4-2-0 red locomotive, #99). Bugs, instead, calls out to Sam to stop his train. Both openly state that neither will stop their train unless the other stops his first. Thinking Bugs wants to play dirty, Sam tells Bugs they'll see who stops their train first when they crash and advances the regulator in his locomotive. Bugs accepts this duel and advances the regulator of the engine in his train. As both trains rush towards each other head on, Sam keeps a stern face and Bugs remains calm. Almost to collision, Sam considers blowing his locomotive's whistle, but instead ducks down to wait for the crash. Bugs, however, extends the \"legs\" on the cars of his train so that Sam's passes harmlessly underneath. Just as Sam gets up and wonders why there was no crash, he spots a sign reading \"End of Line\" and his train falls off an unfinished trestle bridge and into a lake below.\nBugs, in his engine's cab, then calls out a goodbye to Sam and drives off to St. Louis. The final shot shows Sam's locomotive, up to its smokestack in the lake. With his enemy vanquished, Bugs yells \"So long, screwy, see ya in Saint Louie!\" Sam pokes out of the smokestack, blackened with soot, watching Bugs already in the distance, and openly admits to the audience: \"I hate that rabbit!\""}
