{"mid": "DerWixxer", "IMDB_id": "tt0313021", "title": "Der Wixxer", "plot": "The film begins at BlackWhite castle, one of the last castles in black & white located in the United Kingdom. Residing there is the Earl of Cockwood (Thomas Fritsch), a notorious gangster. At some point, a tourist couple from Bitterfeld gets lost in the woods and witness a murder: the Monk with the Whip gets overrun by a truck. At the wheel: The Wixxer, an evil gangster who wears a skull mask and wants to take over Londons crime scene. To do that he arranges for the death of many of the current gangsters.\nScotland Yard sends its - allegedly - best man, Chief Inspector Even Longer. Since the Wixxer killed Even Longer's partner Rather Short (Thomas Heinze), a new partner is assigned: Very Long. They start to investigate and suspect the Earl of Cockwood. However, the Earl (who officially raises pugs and unofficially smuggles girl groups, amongst other things) is affected by the Wixxer's ambitions as well.\nTheir investigations bring the two inspectors back to London where they meet the dubious Harry Smeerlap (Lars Rudolph) and his men, who work for Cockwood. Smeerlap tries to conceal his racketeerings, but Very Long and Even Longer can finally arrest him. At the end they are able to finally identify the Wixxer: it is none other than Rather Short who killed the original Wixxer and assumed his identity."}
