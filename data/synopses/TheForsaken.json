{"mid": "TheForsaken", "IMDB_id": "tt0245120", "title": "The Forsaken", "plot": "Tooling along the open road in a restored vintage Mercedes\nconvertible would be the ultimate vacation, don't you think? That's just\nwhat Sean [Kerr Smith] is doing, with only a few caveats. One is that the car isn't\nhis. He's merely been hired to drive the Mercedes from California to\nFlorida. The second is that he has strict instructions not to pick up any\nhitchhikers. No problem. Sean can handle it...that is, until he gets a\nflat tire in Arizona, is forced to spend the night in a motel room\nadjacent to some very noisy neighbors, loses his wallet, and picks up a\nhitchhiker to help pay for gas. Nick [Brendan Fehr] seems like a nice guy, not a psycho\nor anything. What Sean doesn't know is that Nick is a vampire hunter and\nthat Sean is about to get caught in his worst nightmare.Sean and Nick make a pitstop at a roadside rest area. As they are\ngetting back in their car, they are asked to help jumpstart the dead\nbattery on a red Charger, which Sean recognizes as belonging to his noisy\nneighbors from the night before. Nick also recognizes them as the vampires\nKit [Johnathon Schaech], Cym [Phina Oruche], and Teddy [Alexis Thorpe] and their renfield day-driver, Pen [Simon Rex]. Cym recognizes\nNick as a vampire hunter but Kit decides to bide time before killing him.Later that evening, after securing a room at the Palms Inn Motel,\nSean and Nick get a bite to eat. While leaving the restaurant, they\nencounter a sick girl whom Nick takes back to the motel room and\ntosses in an icebath. When Megan [Izabella Miko] starts screaming, Nick holds her down while\nSean gives her a shot of morphine, explaining that he knows what is\nhappening to her...she has a blood disorder caused by a virus and the only\nway to cure it is to kill the original source of the infection.\nUnfortunately, while covering her mouth with his hand to stifle her\nscreams, Sean gets bitten. The next morning, when Nick tells Sean that\nhe's been bitten by a vampire, Sean doesn't believe it. Nick waltzes Sean\nout to the motel parking area where they find the red Charger with Pen\nsleeping on the hood. Nick knocks out Pen by hitting him with a shovel,\nfinds his car keys, and tells Sean to open the trunk, whereupon Sean is\nimmediately attacked by Teddy. After Nick whacks Teddy a few times with a\nshovel, Teddy bursts into flames in the sun.Beginning to believe, Sean asks Nick how he knows about vampires or\n\"the Forsaken and their feeders\", as Nick refers to them. Nick shows the\nbite on his own arm, incurred about a year ago by a feeder at a party.\nSince then, he has been searching for the Forsaken who turned her.\nMeanwhile, he's been keeping himself from turning by gulping pills\n(antigens, amino acids, and proteins), developed to slow the HIV virus but\nalso effective against the vampire virus...for a while. Nick makes Sean\nstart taking them, too.When they stop for some fried lizard at a diner in Texas, Sean asks\nabout the Forsaken. What are they? The Forsaken are the first vampires,\nNick explains, created during the seige at Antioch during the Great\nCrusade when the Turks slaughtered over 200 French knights. Only nine\nsurvived. The nine were visited that night by a demon who lurks around\nbattlefields looking for souls to steal. He made a deal with eight of the\nknights, giving them life eternal. To seal the deal, the eight killed and\ndrank the blood of the ninth. The next morning, however, they were so\nashamed that they hid from the sun in a cave; the next night, they went\ntheir separate ways. And so, the Forsaken spread across the world. About\n300 years later, one was killed during the Spanish Inquisition. Since\nthen, three more have been destroyed, leaving four remaining. One is in\nAfrica, one in Eastern Europe, and two in the U.S., including the vampire\nKit. The virus is telegenetic, so those bitten remain in touch with their\nprogenating Forsaken. When the progenator is destroyed, so is the link and\nthe whole strain dies out. The problem is that the Forsaken can only be\nkilled on hallowed ground, so Nick suggests that they head for this old\nSpanish mission some 60 miles away and wait there for Kit to find them.Unfortunately, they never make it. That night, as Nick and Sean\ndrive, the vampires catch up with them, ramming the back of the Mercedes\nwith their Charger, taking potshots at the fenders and gas tank, and\nsideswiping the car doors. Each time Nick and Sean manage to elude them,\nthe vampires catch up. Eventually, the Mercedes runs out of gas, and the\nvampire hunters are forced to stop at a house along the road. There is no\ngas to be had, but the owner, an elderly lady named Ina Hamm [Carrie Snodgrass], invites them\nin so that Megan can rest. During the night, Ina's house is attacked by\nKit and Cym. Nick is happy to learn that Ina's house was built over an old\ngraveyard. They're on hallowed ground, the best place to make a stand. In\nthe melee that follows, Nick is shot and Sean's leg is broken, but they\nmanage to shoot off Cym's head. Just as it looks like Kit is going to get\nSean, the rising sun streams through the window, frying Kit. Sean and\nMegan are cured, but not Nick. It turns out that Kit wasn't the progenator\nof the feeder who bit him. Nick's search goes on.Epilogue: It is three months later. Nick is hitching in Colorado when a red\nCharger stops for him. It is Sean, headed for Denver and hot on the trail\nof the other Forsaken. As the two drive off together, Nick wonders if the\nowner of the Mercedes was pissed about the car. \"Oh, yeah!\" Sean exclaims. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"}
