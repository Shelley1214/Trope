{"mid": "HerrMeetsHare", "IMDB_id": "tt0037774", "title": "Herr Meets Hare", "plot": "The cartoon opens with a faux Walter Winchell-like voice discussing the end of the Third Reich, saying that \"Germany has been battered into a fare-thee-well\", and musing about where the high leadership, and \"Fatso\" G\u00f6ring in particular has gone. The scene soon cuts to the Black Forest, where Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2014in bemedalled lederhosen\u2014is \"soothing his jangled nerves\" marching while on a hunt. Nearby, a familiar furrow in the ground appears, with a hole at the end.\nBugs pops out of the hole, and sees no sign of the Black Forest on his map (variants of this scene would be used in later cartoons as the lead-in to the joke that Bugs, while tunneling underground, did indeed turn wrong somewhere in New Mexico, usually by not taking a left turn at Albuquerque. This cartoon is the first time Bugs says the popular catchphrase: \"I KNEW I \u2018shoulda\u2019 (should have) made \u2018dat\u2019 (that) left \u2018toin\u2019 (turn) at \u2018Albakoikie\u2019 (Albuquerque)\"). Bugs asks G\u00f6ring about the directions to Las Vegas, oblivious to his location. G\u00f6ring is almost tricked into going to Las Vegas, but then quickly realizes, \"Las Veegas? Why, there is no Las Veegas in Germany!\" before he fires his musket at Bugs. Genuinely alarmed by his mistaken destination (\"Joimany [Germany]?! Yipe!\"), Bugs hightails it. G\u00f6ring chases after the rabbit, trying to suck Bugs out of his hole with his musket as a plunger.\nA few chase gags go by in which Bugs insults the integrity of G\u00f6ring\u2019s medals by bending one with his teeth. Suckered into bending one himself, G\u00f6ring declares them ersatz and mumbles all sorts of anti-Hitler sentiments (\"Oh, do I hate that Hitler swine, that phony f\u00fchrer, that\u2026\"). Bugs masquerades as Adolf Hitler using a bit of mud, and faces the surprised G\u00f6ring. G\u00f6ring disappears off-screen in a flash to change into his Nazi uniform adorned with all sorts of medals. After the usual Nazi salute, Bugs berates him in faux German as he rips all of the medals off G\u00f6ring's uniform (Klooten-flooten-blooten-pooten-meirooten-tooten!), quickly followed by his belt. G\u00f6ring \"kisses\" in reverence, saying, \"Look! I kiss mein F\u00fchrer\u2019s hand. I kiss right in der F\u00fchrer\u2019s face!\" (the joke being a wildly popular song at the time of the same name composed by Oliver Wallace, and performed by Spike Jones's band, and the subject of a rival short animated subject from the Walt Disney Company). Afterwards, G\u00f6ring exclaims \"Oh, I\u2019m a bad flooten-boy-glooten!\", a variant on Warner Bros. cartoons' frequently-cited Lou Costello-type catchphrase: \"I'm a bad boy!\".\nLater, when the jig is up, Bugs rides in on a white horse, dressed as Br\u00fcnhilde\u2014from Wagnerian opera, to the tune of the \"Pilgrims\u2019 Chorus\" from Tannh\u00e4user). Entranced, G\u00f6ring responds by dressing up as Siegfried. The two dance, before Bugs once again makes a fool of G\u00f6ring and escapes (a scene later re-used in What's Opera, Doc?, co-starring Elmer Fudd).\nEventually, G\u00f6ring gets a hawk to capture Bugs. Bugs, standing next to G\u00f6ring asks, \"Do you think he\u2019ll catch me, doc?\" to which G\u00f6ring replies, \"Do I think he'll catch you? Why, he\u2019ll have you back here before you can say Schicklgruber.\" (Schicklgruber was the original surname of Hitler\u2019s father Alois.) Bugs runs off and jumps into his rabbit hole, but as he falls down the hole, the hawk, which imitates Jimmy Durante, catches Bugs in a bag, capturing him. G\u00f6ring brings the bag to Hitler, who plays solitaire in front of a map depicting the decline of Fortress Europe. G\u00f6ring identifies the captive in the bag as \"Bugsenheimer Bunny\" (as opposed to \"Weisenheimer\", or \"wise guy\") to der F\u00fchrer. As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he\u2019s going to pile upon G\u00f6ring for this act of heroism, he peeks inside the bag and is shocked (\"Ach!! Himmel!\"). G\u00f6ring goes and looks inside the bag as well, to be shocked as well (again, \"Ach!! Himmel!\"). Out of the bag comes Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin\u2014complete with an enormous pipe and a large moustache\u2014staring back at them. As the cartoon ends, Bugs glances back at the camera and asks, in a Russian accent: \"Does your tobacco taste different lately?\", citing an ad slogan of that era for the Sir Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco manufactured by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company."}
