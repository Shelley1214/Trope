{"mid": "InvasionOfTheBunnySnatchers", "IMDB_id": "tt0104527", "title": "Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers", "plot": "The cartoon opens with a voice-over by Bugs Bunny explaining that strange carrots have traveled from outer space to Earth. Afterwards, Bugs goes to \"work\"\u2014performing comedy routines with Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck. During the routines, Bugs takes notice of a strange pile of glowing carrots, but ignores them. The next day, Bugs wakes up and returns to work, but Elmer, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck appear as poorly drawn versions of themselves, including a brief segment where Daffy Duck is animated in the style of Syncro-Vox. They possess strangely friendly attitudes, and repeatedly offer Bugs Bunny a carrot. Bugs eventually accepts and takes the carrot home with him. The carrot rips open and expels a poorly drawn version of Bugs. The impostor attempts to kill the real Bugs with an axe, and Bugs runs off screaming (but pauses to state \"You know something, folks? This is the scariest part of the picture.\"). Bugs finds tags reading \"Made on Planet Nudnik\" on the Elmer, Sam, and Daffy replacements, who have devolved into mindlessly spouting their catchphrases like a broken record. Bugs catches the impostors in a bag labeled \"pale stereotypes\" and sends it into outer space, where it gets swallowed by a black hole. The following morning, Bugs wakes up to find all of his enemies back to normal.\nThe song Mysterious Mose plays along with the credits, and afterwards a Porky Pig impostor in Monty Python-esque animation pops out of the Looney Tunes drum. As it tries to utter the line \"That's all, Folks!\", Bugs throws out the impostor and drags in the real Porky Pig, placing him inside the drum, where he delivers his line."}
