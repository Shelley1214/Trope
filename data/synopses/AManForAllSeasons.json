{"mid": "AManForAllSeasons", "IMDB_id": "tt0060665", "title": "A Man for All Seasons", "plot": "The film covers the years 1529 to 1533, during the reign of King Henry VIII.\nCardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles), the Lord Chancellor of England, summons Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) to Hampton Court, one of the principal royal palaces in the vicinity of London, for a private, late-night meeting. As both men know, King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) wishes to divorce his wife Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave). Saying that England needs a male heir to prevent another period of dynastic wars like the Wars of the Roses and that Henry's present queen cannot provide one, Wolsey chastises More for being the only member of the Privy Council to oppose Wolsey's policies to obtain a divorce from the Vatican. More states that he can never go along with Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England to force the issue. Unknown to More, the conversation is overheard by Wolsey's aide, Thomas Cromwell.\nReturning to his home at Chelsea at dawn, More finds Richard Rich (John Hurt), a young acquaintance, waiting by the dock for his return, lobbying for a position at Court. More recommends against that, citing many corruptions, and instead recommends Rich find a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's advice, saying that has little prestige.\nMore enters his house to find his daughter Meg (Susannah York) chatting with a brilliant young lawyer named William Roper (Corin Redgrave), who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly Catholic More states that he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a Lutheran.\nSome time later, Wolsey dies of a heart attack. King Henry appoints More as Lord Chancellor of England to succeed Wolsey.\nThe King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate to inquire about his divorce. More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded Royal favour. After the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.\nRoper, learning of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably: He declares that by attacking the Church, the King has become \"the Devil's minister.\" More admonishes him to be more guarded as Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern). An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\"\nHumiliated, Rich joins Cromwell in attempting to bring down More. Meanwhile, the King has Parliament declare him \"Supreme Head of the Church of England.\" He demands that both the bishops and Parliament renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. As he does so, his close friend, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk (Nigel Davenport), attempts to draw his opinions out as part of a friendly chat with no witnesses present. More, however, knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over.\nCromwell, in a meeting with Norfolk, implies that More's troubles would be over were he to attend the King's wedding to Anne Boleyn. When More declines the invitation, he is summoned again to Hampton Court, now occupied by Cromwell. More is interrogated, but refuses to answer. Infuriated, Cromwell declares that the King views him as a traitor, but allows him to return home.\nUpon returning home, Meg informs her father that a new oath is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of high treason. Initially, More says he would be willing to take the oath, provided it refers only to the King's marriage to Boleyn. Upon learning that it names the King as Supreme Head of the Church, More refuses to take it and is subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London.\nMore remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain his objections, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he hasn't explicitly denied the King's supremacy. A request for new books to read backfires, resulting in confiscation of the books he has, and Rich removes them from More's cell.\nMore is finally brought to trial, but refuses to speak about the marriage or why he will not take the Oath, and cites his silence in defense. Rich then testifies that when he came to take away More's books, More told him he would not take the Oath because the King could not be Head of the Church, thus committing treason by contradicting the Act of Supremacy. More is convicted of treason on the perjured testimony of Rich, who has been made Attorney General for Wales as a reward.\nMore says goodbye to his wife Alice (Wendy Hiller), Meg and Roper, urging them not to try and defend him. With nothing left to lose, More denounces the King's actions as illegal. As grounds, he cites the Biblical basis for the authority of the Papacy over Christendom. He further declares that the Church's immunity to State interference is guaranteed both in Magna Carta and in the King's own Coronation Oath. As the audience screams in protest, More is condemned to death by beheading. Before his execution on Tower Hill, More pardons the executioner, and says, \"I die His Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\""}
