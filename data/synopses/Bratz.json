{"mid": "Bratz", "IMDB_id": "tt0804452", "title": "Bratz", "plot": "Four teenage friends named Cloe, Yasmin, Sasha and Jade are about to start high school. Self-centered Meredith wants everyone to belong to a clique, and goes about organizing students. She does not like the independent spirit of the four girls and plots to destroy their friendship and make them conform to her pre-fabricated cliques. Cloe is an amazing soccer player. She meets Cameron and is instantly smitten. Sasha is recruited as a cheerleader. Jade joins the science club, meets Dexter and designs great outfits. Yasmin joins journalism, even though her real passion is singing even though she hasn't realized yet. She also feels lonely as her friends are busy with their own cliques. She also meets Dylan who is deaf but can lip reading (lip read). The friends begin to drift apart as they are compelled to stay within their cliques.\nTwo years later, when an accidental food fight causes them to get detention, they realize that they miss being BFF's and decide to be friends again. They also try to get the other schoolmates to socialize outside their cliques but their attempts fail when Meredith's 2nd Super Sweet 16 party which ends disastrously has them seated with their original cliques.\nThe upcoming talent show and its prize of a scholarship gives them the idea to bring all the cliques together again with an act, but the chances are slim with Meredith's constant attempts to steal the spotlight. In the end, there is a tie. Meredith gets the trophy, but the girls get the scholarship, which they later give to Cloe."}
