{"mid": "GoldilocksAndTheThreeBears", "IMDB_id": "tt0862707", "title": "Goldilocks and the Three Bears", "plot": "In Southey's tale, three anthropomorphic bears \u2013 \"a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear\" \u2013 live together in a house in the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these \"bachelor\" bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman named silver hair approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The silver haired old lady eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and silver hair in his bed and cries, \"Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!\" silver hair starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital."}
