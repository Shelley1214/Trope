{"mid": "BacallToArms", "IMDB_id": "tt0038318", "title": "Bacall to Arms", "plot": "The cartoon is set in a movie theater. Various random gags occur before the film, such as one patron moving to another seat another patron taking the vacated seat, and so on, accelerating into a free-for-all. A wolf makes a pass at a sexy movie usherette, gets slapped in the face, then settles down for the show. While the theater is in color, the films-within-the film are black-and-white. A short \"newsreel\" is narrated by Robert C. Bruce.\nThe main feature is a film called To Have- To Have- To Have- ..., a parody of To Have and Have Not. It includes images of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who are credited as \"Bogey Gocart and Laurie Becool\". In addition to recreating a few well-known scenes from that film (the kissing scene; the \"put your lips together and blow\" scene), the players sometimes lapse into slapstick (Bacall lighting her cigarette with a blowtorch \u00e0 la Harpo Marx; or letting loose with a loud, shrill whistle after her famous sultry comment) and interact with the theater audience.\nAlthough the theater was initially full, it is eventually seen to be empty except for one patron: a literal lone wolf in a zoot suit who goes ga-ga over Bacall. The final gag has the wolf grabbing a cigarette that was dropped in the film and jumps off the screen, and Bogie shoots him. He hands it to Bogie and it explodes, covering him with \"blackface\". Bogie suddenly adopts a \"Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson\" voice, and says, \"Mah, oh mah! I can work fo' Mr. Benny nah!\""}
