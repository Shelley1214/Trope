{"mid": "TheBigSnit", "IMDB_id": "tt0088805", "title": "The Big Snit", "plot": "A married couple plays a game of Scrabble that has stalemated as the husband is unable to come up with a word. The two go their separate ways; he watches his favorite TV show, \"Sawing for Teens,\" while his wife works on cleaning the house. While the husband dozes off, \"Sawing for Teens\" is interrupted by the emergency warning: global nuclear war has begun, and the streets have descended into chaos. As he awakens, his cat severs the TV's electrical cord, and he returns to the game board, unaware of the global cataclysm, and sneaking a peek at his wife's letters. The wife, finished with her cleaning and also oblivious, catches him in the act, which he denies. The two begin arguing over every petty flaw each one has, to the point where the wife runs away in tears.\nThe husband spots an old photo of him and his wife at \"Expo 67,\" prompting memories of the couple in happier times. Unable to console his wife, he begins playing the concertina (poorly), which softens his wife enough for both of them to reconcile. As the cat claws to be let outside, the husband obliges and reaches for the doorknob. At that moment, a white glow emanates from the keyhole and the husband is vaporized, implying that a nuclear bomb has detonated nearby and that everyone has been instantly killed.\nThe door then opens and, instead of chaos, a vision of Heaven is seen outside. The couple, unaware of their apparent death, marvels at the beauty of the scene and decides to return to their Scrabble game."}
