One day, an old man arrives at his apartment to tell him he is the last descendent of H.P. Lovecraft and must guard a relic to keep it from being reunited; if the pieces of the relic are united while the stars are in alignment, the sunken city of R'lyeh will rise from the sea and the demonic creature Cthulhu will be released upon an unsuspecting world.\nShortly thereafter, squid-like \"deep ones\" attack and Jeff flees with his friend Charlie, a comic book artist. Cult followers of Cthulhu pursue them to reunite the relic. They find an old high school acquaintance, Paul, and enlist him in their cause. The three flee to the desert to seek Captain Olaf, a sailor who has first-hand experience with the cult. Eventually, the cult members attack them and Paul is taken by the cult, only to later escape and reunite at Olaf's RV. Cthulhu's general, Starspawn, and the deep ones corner them in the captain's RV. In their haste to flee, Jeff and Charlie leave the relic behind, and Starspawn re-assembles it. This causes everyone but Jeff, as the last in the Lovecraft bloodline, excruciating pain. As Cthulhu prepares to escape his undersea prison, Jeff shoots some dynamite, destroying Star Spawn, separating the relic, and saving the world.\nSometime later, we see Charlie doing a comic book signing for his new book based on his and Jeff's adventures. While telling a small disbelieving comic fan that the story is true, Jeff arrives with an ancient map of more artifacts they must safeguard. They quickly leave for the Antarctic and arrive at the Mountains of Madness."}
