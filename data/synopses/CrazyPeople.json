{"mid": "CrazyPeople", "IMDB_id": "tt0099316", "title": "Crazy People", "plot": "Emory Leeson is an advertising executive who experiences a nervous breakdown. He designs a series of \"truthful\" advertisements, blunt and bawdy and of no use to his boss Drucker's firm.\nOne of his colleagues, Stephen Bachman, checks him into a psychiatric hospital. Emory goes into group therapy under the care of Dr. Liz Baylor and meets other voluntary patients, such as the lovely and vulnerable Kathy Burgess. There is also George, who can speak only one word: \"Hello.\"\nBy mistake, Emory's advertisements get printed and the new campaign turns out to be a tremendous success. Campaigns like: \"Jaguar \u2014 For men who'd like hand-jobs from beautiful women they hardly know.\" and \"Volvo \u2014 they're boxy but they're good.\"\nDrucker grabs credit for the ads. He assigns Stephen and the rest of his employees to design similar new ad campaigns featuring so-called honesty in advertising, but nothing works.\nEmory is approached in the sanitarium about creating new ads himself. He insists that his fellow mental patients also be involved and suitably rewarded for their work, transforming the sanitarium into a branch of the advertising industry.\nThey come up with wild advertising slogans, like one for a Greek travel agency that goes: \"Forget Paris. The French can be annoying. Come to Greece. We're nicer.\" And another one called \"Come\u2026 IN the Bahamas\" for the islands' national tourism board.\nThe patients experience happiness at being needed and improve from their various illnesses. The evil Drucker and the doctor in charge of the hospital get greedy and try to separate the team. But it doesn't work. Dr. Baylor defies her boss and Emory negotiates to get new automobiles for all of the patients. Emory and Kathy, who have fallen in love, leave the hospital in an army helicopter piloted by Kathy's long-lost brother."}
