Other sketches spoof TV commercials and programs, news broadcasts, and classroom educational films. The city of Detroit and its high crime rate are a running gag portraying the city as Hell on Earth; in \"A Fistful of Yen\", the evil drug lord orders a captured CIA agent to be sent to Detroit, and the agent screams and begs to be killed instead.\nThe film is number 87 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies,\" and is considered, along with The Groove Tube, to be one of the groundbreaking films of the entire spoof and mockumentary genres of film making.\n=== Sketch selection ===\nThe film's credits listed the sketches incorrectly, as the writers changed the show order after the credits had been written.
