{"mid": "UnderWraps", "IMDB_id": "tt0128801", "title": "Under Wraps", "plot": "Three 12-year-old kids discover a mummy in the basement of a \"dead\" man's house. It comes alive due to the conjunction of the moonlight during that time of the month. They are scared of him at first, but with time discover he is friendly, if clumsy and confused. The kids name the mummy Harold, and decide he will temporarily take up residence in one kid's bedroom. After paying a visit to their Halloween-obsessed friend, Bruce, they discover that if the mummy is not put back in his coffin before midnight on Halloween, the mummy will cease to exist.\nHowever, the sarcophagus is in the hands of the \"dead\" man, known as Mr. Kubat, who feigned his death to avoid paying his taxes. Upon finding out that the mummy has \"escaped\" from the coffin, he orders his henchmen to look for the mummy and bring it back in time, as he is selling it to an interested buyer. On top of that, there are a few other obstacles that follow by. For one thing, Harold's unusual appearance may attract unwanted attention as Halloween night draws closer. Meanwhile, they find out that Harold used to be in love with another mummy who comes alive at the end."}
