{"mid": "KillerElite", "IMDB_id": "tt1448755", "title": "Killer Elite", "plot": "In 1980, mercenaries Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), Hunter (Robert De Niro), Davies (Dominic Purcell), and Meier (Aden Young) are in Mexico to assassinate a man. Danny unwittingly kills him in front of his young child, then is injured during the getaway. Affected by this outcome, Danny retires and returns to his native Australia.\nThe following year, Danny is summoned to Oman where Hunter is being held captive. He meets with an agent (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who arranges missions for assassins and learns that Hunter accepted a $6 million job but failed to accomplish it. If Danny doesn't complete Hunter's mission, Hunter will be executed.\nDanny is introduced to Sheikh Amr, a deposed king of a small region of Oman who wants Danny to kill three former SAS troopers\u2014Steven Harris (Lachy Hulme), Steven Cregg (Grant Bowler), and Simon McCann (Daniel Roberts)\u2014for killing his three eldest sons during the Dhofar Rebellion. Danny must videotape their confessions and make their deaths look like accidents, and he must do it before the terminally ill Sheikh dies. This will allow the Sheikh's fourth son, Bakhait (Firass Dirani), to regain control of the desert region his father had ruled. If Danny fails, Hunter will be killed. Danny reunites with Davies and Meier. They agree to help him in exchange for a share of the money.\nAs Danny and Meier sneak into the house of their first target, Steven Harris, in Oman, Davies, in England, questions local bar patrons about former SAS members. This is reported to the Feathermen, a secret society of former operatives protecting their own. Their head enforcer, Spike Logan (Clive Owen), is sent to investigate.\nAfter Harris has confessed on videotape, Danny and Meier take him to the bathroom. They plan to kill him by hitting him over the head with a hammer made from a bathroom tile, then leave the body to look like Harris slipped and hit his head. In the process, Harris' girlfriend arrives, knocking on the door. While Harris and Meier are distracted waiting for her to leave, Harris attempts to break free, causing Meier to kill him hastily in a struggle.\nBack in London, Davies discovers the second target, Steven Cregg, preparing for a long nighttime march in wintry weather at the Brecon Beacons mountain range. Davies creates a diversion; posing as a civilian having car problems outside the base's fence, allowing Danny to infiltrate the base. Inside, he drugs Cregg's coffee, causing him to go into shock and die of hypothermia during the march. Danny, in uniform, follows Cregg on the march, and makes him confess on videotape before he dies.\nTheir last target, Simon McCann, currently works as a mercenary, after being discharged from the SAS following a car bombing that made him mentally unstable. Their plan is to rig a truck to respond to remote control, and crash it into McCann's car while he is driving, making his death look like a traffic accident. With the help of a new and inexperienced team member, Jake (Michael Dorman), Meier successfully kills McCann; however, Logan and his men were watching over McCann. A gun fight in the docks ensues, and Meier is accidentally killed by the inexperienced Jake. Danny and Davies decide that the case is over, and they part ways. Soon after, Davies is tracked down by Logan's men, and is hit by a truck and killed while trying to escape them.\nDanny returns to Oman and gives the Sheikh the last taped confession, which he has faked. Hunter is released and returns to his family, while Danny heads back to Australia and reunites with Anne (Yvonne Strahovski), a childhood acquaintance. Soon, he is informed by the Agent that there is one last man who participated in the Sheikh's sons' murders and that this man, Ranulph Fiennes, is about to release a book about his experiences as a member of the SAS.\nDanny tells Anne to go to France with Hunter to protect her while he carries out the last job. The Sheikh\u2019s son confirms that Harris was an innocent man. Logan, meanwhile, traces Danny through the Agent and sends a team to protect the author, but Jake distracts them, allowing Danny to infiltrate the building and shoot the author. He chooses to only wound the author, however, but takes pictures that appear to show him dead. Logan chases and captures Danny, taking him to an abandoned warehouse, but he is interrupted when an agent from the British government arrives and reveals that the British government is behind the events because of the Sheikh's valuable oil reserves. A three-way battle ensues, with Danny escaping and Logan shooting the government agent.\nIn Paris, Anne goes to take the subway. The Agent and a henchman are waiting for her because the Agent plans to kidnap her for ransom. But Hunter follows her, beats the henchman and shoots the Agent in the leg. The Agent then tries to explain that it is just for business. Hunter seems threatening at first, but then spares his life.\nDanny and Hunter head to Oman to give the Sheikh the pictures. However, Logan arrives first, confronts the Sheikh, telling him that the pictures are fake and then stabs him to death. The Sheikh's son does not care and gives over the money, which was intended for Danny and Hunter, to Logan. Hunter spots Logan leaving, and they chase after him, along with the Sheikh's men.\nAfter stopping the Sheikh's men, Danny and Hunter confront Logan on a desert road. Danny says that Logan can keep the money (though Hunter takes some for his expenses and his family). They give Logan the remainder, telling him that he'll need it to start a new life away from the government after killing the government agent and acting against the wishes of the Feathermen and the British government. Danny says that it's over for him and that Logan must make up his own mind. They leave him there, saying they'll send a cab for him from the airport. Danny meets with Anne in France to start a new life."}
