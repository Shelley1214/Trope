{"mid": "YiYi", "IMDB_id": "tt0244316", "title": "Yi yi", "plot": "Yi Yi depicts the trials and tribulations of the Jian family of Taipei. The narrative shifts between three perspectives: the middle-aged father NJ (Wu Nien-jen), the young son Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), and the teenage daughter, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee). The film starts with a wedding, concludes with a funeral, and contemplates areas of human life in between.\nThe father, NJ, is dissatisfied with his work and the desire of his business partners to enter into a deal with a well-known Japanese videogame company. While his partners are only concerned about making money, NJ finds that his honest nature is unappreciated in the commercial realm. To his surprise, he connects with the Japanese software mogul, Ota. Meanwhile, an old flame, Sherry, tries to come back into his life following a chance reunion.\nYang-Yang, NJ's son, is having troubles at school. He is picked on by both his female classmates and one of his teachers. However, he develops an interest in photography that buoys him through these hardships.\nFinally, Ting-Ting, NJ's daughter-in-law, gets involved in a love triangle that includes her friend next door and the neighbor's troubled boyfriend.\nAll three characters have to deal with their problems while caring for NJ's comatose mother-in-law, as NJ's wife has left for a Buddhist retreat in order to cope with a midlife crisis. In addition, A-Di, NJ's overweight brother-in-law who marries a starlet at the start of the film, balances relationships with his demanding wife and a former love, complicating matters within his extended family.\nThe other Taiwanese cast members include Elaine Jin as NJ's wife, Min-Min, Su-Yun Ko as NJ's former love Sherry, Hsi-Sheng Chen as A-Di, and Pang Chang Yu as Fatty. The film also stars Japanese comedian Issey Ogata as a Japanese software mogul, Ota."}
