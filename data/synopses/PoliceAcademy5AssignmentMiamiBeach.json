But before he retires, Lassard is chosen as \"Police Officer of the Decade,\" and brings his favorite graduates\u2014Sgts. Hightower, Jones, Tackleberry and Hooks, Lt. Callahan, and new graduate Officer Thomas \"House\" Conklin\u2014to the National Police Chiefs Convention in Miami Beach to celebrate with him. While there, they meet his nephew, Sgt. Nick Lassard of the Miami Police Department. Lassard unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen diamonds.\nAs the jewel thieves try to get the bag back, and Captain Harris tries to prove to Commissioner Hurst that he's the right man to replace Commandant Lassard, the usual hijinks ensue, including Lassard trying to guess the annual procedural demonstration. When the jewel thieves kidnap Commandant Lassard, he goes willingly, thinking it's indeed the procedural demonstration. It launches a negotiation, which Captain Harris botches, getting himself captured as well. A chase across the Everglades ensues to rescue the oblivious Commandant. In a standoff with the smugglers, Nick explains to his uncle that the situation isn't a demonstration and that his kidnappers are in fact real criminals. Lassard, upon hearing this information, promptly disarms and subdues his assailants to the amazement of all the officers. At a ceremony at the end of the film, Commissioner Hurst announces that Commadant Lassard will be allowed to continue his duties as Commadant until he sees fit to retire, much to Harris' chagrin, as well as Hightower's promotion to Lieutenant."}
