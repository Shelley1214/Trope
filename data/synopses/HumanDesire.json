When Carl is fired for talking back to his boss, he pleads with Vicki to go into the city to see the man she used to work for, John Owens (Grandon Rhodes), a railroad executive who can get Carl his job back. Unbeknownst to Carl, Vicki did more than just work for Owens, and she allows Owens to bed her again in order to get Carl his job.\nCarl suspects Vicki and in a violent argument the truth slips out of her. Carl beats her and forces her to write a letter to Owens, setting up a meeting in a train car. On the trip Carl goes with Vicki, barges into the room when Owens opens the door, and kills Owens with a knife.\nJeff, who is taking a comp ride on this run, happens to be having a smoke in the vestibule near Owens's compartment. Carl makes Vicki go to Jeff as a distraction so Carl can hide himself.\nAt the inquest for the murder of Owens, Jeff is called as a witness. The various passengers on the train that night are asked to stand.

She finally explains about the killing, and the letter Carl keeps hidden so Vicki will be forced to stay with him. She suggests the only way they'll ever be free is if Jeff kills Carl, making it look like a drunken accident at the rail yard.\nJeff follows the drunk Carl through the yard. But he returns to Vicki saying he couldn't do it, and accuses Vicki of setting him up from the start just so he would kill her husband. She protests that she really does love Jeff, but it's too late. He leaves her, but gives her one thing as he does\u2013\u2013the letter, which he took from the drunken Carl without his knowledge.\nVicki is now free to leave Carl. She gets on the next train.
