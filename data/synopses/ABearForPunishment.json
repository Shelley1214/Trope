{"mid": "ABearForPunishment", "IMDB_id": "tt0043322", "title": "A Bear for Punishment", "plot": "The film begins with the bear family sleeping peacefully at home, when suddenly, the alarms of dozens of clocks located on Junyer Bear's table go off. Papa Bear wakes up completely and runs to try to turn them off. Junyer excitedly wakes up and exclaims: \"Oh, boy! At last the great day has come at last! Oh, boy!\" Papa Bear asks how to stop the alarms, and his son simply shushes the clocks. Dad gets angry and smacks a clock in Junyer's face. Mom replies: \"But, Henry ...\" Henry shouts: \"Well! What do you Want!?\" To which Mom replies: \"It's Father's Day, Dear.\"\nThen Mama Bear and Junyer Bear make several activities to please Papa Bear on his day, but only cause discomfort and misery, ending with a theatrical presentation in which there are three numbers, of which the latter involves a song called, Let's Give a Cheer for Father. This number ends with Mama Bear and Junyer Bear dressed as parents of the American homeland (George Washington and Abraham Lincoln respectively), who disguise Papa Bear as the Statue of Liberty and shoot fireworks, as an allegory of July 4th."}
