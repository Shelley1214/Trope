{"mid": "MutantChronicles", "IMDB_id": "tt0490181", "title": "Mutant Chronicles", "plot": "The story is set in the year 2707. The world is loosely based on that of the Mutant Chronicles role-playing game, where many technologies are steam powered and mankind has exhausted Earth\u2019s natural resources. The protagonists must battle against mutated humans that were accidentally unleashed.\nThe plot revolves around a \"machine\" which came from space 10,000 years ago. The \"machine\" mutates people into barely intelligent killing drones, known as \"mutants\", that drag new victims to the machine for conversion. Sealed away thousands of years ago by human tribes, the machine is accidentally uncovered during a large battle in Eastern Europe between two of the four corporations that now rule the world. Within six weeks the world is almost completely conquered by the mutant gangs. Some of the population has been evacuated to Mars, but millions remain on the doomed Earth. A group of soldiers are assembled to take another ancient device to the heart of the machine in an attempt to destroy it in a suicide mission. In return, their loved ones receive coveted tickets to Mars.\nEn-route their spaceship is shot down by a kamikaze airship piloted by a mutant. The group is forced to battle through the mutants in underground tunnels to reach the machine, hoping to save the last of humanity. In their attempt to reach the machine most die, with Mitch being partially transformed into a mutant and Brother Samuel being fully transformed. Mitch is able to halt his own transformation, but is forced to kill Brother Samuel. Mitch, being the last survivor, is ultimately successful in activating the ancient device, causing the machine (which was actually part of a spacecraft) to blast off into space.\nA dying and mutated Samuel tells him to \"have faith\" as Mitch jumps from the slowly ascending rocket, landing in an underwater lake beneath the rocket. Crawling onto land he sees the rocket disappear into the sky, realizing he is the prophesied savior of mankind, despite not believing in a god. Grievously wounded and partially mutated, he lights a final crooked cigarette. An ultimate sequence shows the rocket heading for Mars."}
