Jesse is a successful novelist, while C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government.\nThe couple discuss their concerns about Hank, and then about C\u00e9line's choices for her career. Over dinner they talk more about love and life. Friends staying with them pay for a hotel room so they can have a night alone. While walking to the hotel, the couple reminisce about coming together. After reaching the hotel, they have a fierce argument, expressing fears about their present and future together. Among other issues, Jesse wants them to move to Chicago so he can be closer to Hank, which C\u00e9line thinks will cost her any chance of a life outside her family. In the heat of the argument, C\u00e9line tells Jesse she no longer loves him.\nC\u00e9line leaves their room and sits alone in the hotel's outdoor restaurant. Jesse joins her and jokes that he is a time traveler bringing her a letter from her 82-year-old self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. Unamused, C\u00e9line says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality. Jesse proclaims his love, saying he does not know what else she could want. After a moment, C\u00e9line joins in Jesse's joke, and the two seem to reconcile."}
