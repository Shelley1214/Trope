{"mid": "TimePiece", "IMDB_id": "tt0059807", "title": "Time Piece", "plot": "The fast-paced scenes in Time Piece are edited together in a rhythmic pentameter, with an underlying use of sounds and repetitive beats. The film begins with a young man (who provides only four brief words of dialogue who just quotes \"help\") sitting patiently in a hospital bed. An unidentified doctor enters the room and checks the man's heart rate, which begins to pulse rhythmically.\nAs the rhythm increases, the film begins to follow the man's peculiar habits such as crossing a busy street in different clothes and different locations, working in a busy office, working on a conveyor belt, walking through different locations and ending up in a forest where he has the appearance of Tarzan, eating dinner with his wife, walking down the street seeing pogo stick riders, and visiting a strip club while simultaneously maintaining himself in motion.\nEventually, the man is imprisoned for shooting the Mona Lisa while dressed as a cowboy and is forced to perform odd acts of labor like working in the rock pile and painting an Indian elephant pink. The man eventually escapes from prison and begins to frantically run across a long distance with different disguises like Abraham Lincoln and Tarzan while evading cowboys. The man then jumps off a diving board and soars into the sky (aided by a flying device) where he is subsequently shot down by the world's military powers. He falls from the sky defeated and lands in a muddy puddle in the form of a rustic clock. The clock strikes twelve and the film's events flash quickly on-screen.\nBack in the hospital room, the doctor covers the man's seemingly lifeless body. The camera then pans up towards the doctor's face, revealing him to be the same man smiling gleefully while winking."}
