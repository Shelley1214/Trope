Falling through the cracks of society in the United States, they become high-class thieves to get back all they have lost.\nDick Harper is a successful aerospace engineer in Los Angeles, where he and wife Jane have a lovely house, with a swimming pool and new lawn under way. Due to financial reversals at the agency, however, Dick's boss, Charlie Blanchard, suddenly fires him.\nDick and Jane owe more than $70,000 and abruptly have no income. His attempts to find other gainful employment fail. Jane lands a fashion modeling appearance at a restaurant that becomes a fiasco. Dick ends up applying for unemployment and food stamps, while Jane's wealthy parents, rather than help, advise them to use this experience positively as a life lesson.\nUnable to come up with any other solution to their problems, Dick and Jane turn to a life of crime. They make an effort to select their victims judiciously, robbing the telephone company, for instance, which makes customers in line cheer. In time, Dick and Jane weigh their guilty consciences against their needs, trying to get their old lives back and keep out of jail."}
