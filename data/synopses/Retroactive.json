{"mid": "Retroactive", "IMDB_id": "tt0117468", "title": "Retroactive", "plot": "Karen hitches a ride in Frank's car after hers breaks down. Frank is travelling with his abused wife, Rayanne, on his way to sell stolen computer chips. He discovers Rayanne has been unfaithful to him, leading him to kill her. Karen gets into a shooting match with Frank but escapes, ending up at a laboratory where a scientist, Brian, has invented a time machine. Using the machine, Karen returns to a point in time just a few minutes before the violent events. She succeeds in altering the course of events, but not for the better. Going back in time again, things become worse still, with the deaths not only of Rayanne, but also Rayanne's lover, a police officer and a vacationing family. Eventually Karen uses the machine to go back in time far enough that she can avoid getting involved with Frank in the first place. This causes events to unfold without her interference. In this final outcome, Frank kills his accomplice and Rayanne's lover, but is killed by Rayanne."}
