{"mid": "BooToYouTooWinnieThePooh", "IMDB_id": "tt0163558", "title": "Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh", "plot": "On Halloween, Pooh and his friends are eager to go trick-or-treating. Piglet has never gone trick-or-treating, having always been too afraid of the frightening atmosphere of Halloween. After building an imposing mannequin in an attempt to face his fears, he joins his friends in preparation for trick-or-treating. Pooh's attempt to get honey from a bee hive ends in failure, and the bees chase the group into Rabbit's garden, ravaging his pumpkin patch. As night falls and a thunderstorm looms, Tigger overzealously speaks of the horrors of Halloween, frightening Piglet enough that he runs home and barricades the door.\nSympathetic to Piglet's fear, Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger decide to avoid the frightening aspects of Halloween and throw Piglet a less frightening \"Hallo-wasn't\" party instead. When the three costumed friends show up at Piglet's house, he mistakes them for a monster and flees. The trio of friends discover Piglet is missing, and go to search for him in the night. Simultaneously, Piglet goes looking for Pooh and the others, but when he can't find any of his friends, Piglet believes they've all been taken by \"Spookables\".\nStill wearing their costumes, Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger make their way through the increasingly stormy night to find Piglet, but their fears get the best of them. Pooh's costume gets stuck in a tree branch, and the other two struggle to pull him out. Hearing Pooh's cries for help, Piglet happens upon the scene and believes two \"Spookables\" are attacking his friend. Determined to help his friend, Piglet summons his courage and uses his mannequin to seemingly rescue Pooh. When the mannequin collapses in the midst of the ensuing chaos, the others believe Piglet has vanquished the apparent monster. They commend Piglet for his bravery, and they all go trick-or-treating together."}
