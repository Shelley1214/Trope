{"mid": "KorgothOfBarbaria", "IMDB_id": "tt0810644", "title": "Korgoth of Barbaria", "plot": "Korgoth is infected with a deadly parasite by Gog-Ma-Gogg and extorted to steal an item known as \"The Golden Goblin of the Fourth Age\" from the wizard Specules, whom Gog believes to have recently died. He journeys with a group of Gog-Ma-Gogg's henchmen to Specules' castle, picking up a girl and killing several things along the way. The group reaches the castle, considerably smaller than when it had left, and begin to plunder it. As Korgoth searches for the Golden Goblin, Specules returns, explaining that he was on vacation. Specules uses his magic to kill or incapacitate all but Korgoth, who proves too strong for the ridiculous creatures that the wizard conjures through chewing gum. As a last resort, Specules uses his magic directly against Korgoth; however, he is knocked off-balance and accidentally kills Korgoth's girl. Angered, Korgoth takes a two-pronged candle stick holder and impales Specules through the eyes, only to find that the wizard has magically transferred his head onto the dead girl's body. Specules proceeds to fly out the window. Korgoth returns to Gog-Ma-Gogg with the Golden Goblin (a simple modern-age novelty item) and gets the elixir (a laxative) for the deadly parasite, though the elixir takes many seasons to take effect. Korgoth is last seen walking away, pulling a cart full of medicine bottles."}
