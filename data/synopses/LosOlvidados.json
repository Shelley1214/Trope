El Jaibo escapes juvenile jail and reunites with the street gang that he leads. El Jaibo's gang attempts to rob a blind street musician. They fail at first, but later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments.\nWith the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Juli\u00e1n, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his arm in a fake sling and hides a rock in it. El Jaibo confronts Juli\u00e1n, who denies that he reported him to the police. Juli\u00e1n refuses to fight El Jaibo because it wouldn't be a fair fight with El Jaibo's arm broken. As Juli\u00e1n starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the head with the rock. He then beats Juli\u00e1n to death and takes his money. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime, and since he shares Juli\u00e1n's money with Pedro, Pedro is an accomplice to the murder.\nPedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows signs that she doesn't even love him or care for him as a son. Pedro is extremely saddened by this and vows to start behaving better. He finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals an expensive knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the \"farm school,\" where he misbehaves and kills two chickens. The principal gives Pedro a test. He hands Pedro a 50 pesos bill to run errands with as a test of trust. If Pedro returns from the errands, he can be trusted. If he doesn't, the principal is out 50 pesos. Pedro accepts the offer and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him.
