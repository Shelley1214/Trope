{"mid": "LeonardPart6", "IMDB_id": "tt0093405", "title": "Leonard Part 6", "plot": "Bill Cosby plays Leonard Parker, a CIA spy-turned-restaurateur. According to the opening sequence of the movie, the title refers to the idea that this film is actually the sixth installment of a series of films featuring the adventures of Leonard, as parts one through five were locked up in the interests of world security. In actuality, there are no movies preceding this one.\nThe theatrical release poster points out that Leonard Parker is, at the time of his reluctant return to action, coping with domestic issues:\n\"His daughter is engaged to a man old enough to be his father.\nHis estranged wife behaves like she is younger than their daughter.\nAnd now his government has asked him to save the world. Again.\"\nThe movie starts with Parker being called out of retirement by his CIA director Snyderburn (Baker) to save the world from evil vegetarian Medusa Johnson (Foster), who brainwashes animals to kill people. The film ends with Leonard infiltrating Johnson's headquarters (an \"International Tuna\" factory), fending off the vegetarians with magic meat he received from a Gypsy, freeing the captive animals, and flooding the base using Alka-Seltzer. He escapes by riding an ostrich across the roof; the unlikely steed flies him to the ground."}
