His parents' parents and their parents before them were vampire hunters. It's what they do. But when Jack's parents are annihilated by vampires, Jack [Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson] is the last in the line. He is entrusted with \"the bible\", a list of names of vampires, and he sets out to destroy them all. It is now some 20 years later. There are nine vampires left. Jack knocks off four of them as they dine in a family restaurant, but this sets the law and the press looking for him. The press, in the form of Raimy Baker [Melanie Smith], is first to find him. Unfortunately, there is soon to be a solar eclipse during which the vampires can breed, so Jack must shortly find and kill the remaining five. With Raimy's help, he succeeds."}
