The funds are provided by Tommy Schlaaang and the Schlaaang Corporation. The two waste all of their money on the making of Bonjour, Diamond Jim, a three-minute film (based on a poem by \"personal shopper and spiritual guru\" Jim Joe Kelly (Zach Galifianakis) who they paid $500,000 a week), plus expensive makeovers, 10-course lunches, real diamonds for Diamond Jim's suit, and a Johnny Depp impersonator. Because of this, the two leave Los Angeles in fear that they will go to prison or be hunted down by the Schlaaang Corp.\nAfter seeing an advertisement for it in a nightclub bathroom, Tim and Eric decide to renovate the S'Wallow Valley Mall run by Damien Weebs (Will Ferrell), in the hopes that they will make back their billion dollar debt. While trying to refurbish the mall, they must deal with vagrants (such as a man-child named Taquito (John C. Reilly), bizarre stores (such as Reggie's Used Toilet Paper Discount Warehouse), and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court.\nDuring their time at the S'Wallow Valley Mall, Tim and Eric also face many challenges, such as an angry shop owner named Alan Bishopman (Will Forte) who \"doesn't want anything to change\", and the fact that Eric is in love with Katie (Twink Caplan), a woman who works at the mall (whom Eric also compulsively masturbates to.) Because of this, Tim poisons Eric and ends up making love to Katie, whilst Eric goes to the Shrim Alternative Healing Center, run by Dr. Doone Struts (Ray Wise) to seek \"spiritual healing\", only to be placed in a bathtub which gets filled with diarrhea by Struts' sons as part of the \"spiritual healing\". After the event, Eric finds Tim sleeping with Katie and subsequently fights Tim. After the fight, Eric apologizes to Tim for starting the fight and understands why Tim made love to Katie.\nThey are eventually discovered by the Schlaaang Corporation thanks to Alan. After a dramatic shootout in front of the mall, in which most of the main characters are killed, Tim and Eric manage to kill the members of the Schlaaang Corporation, and are sentenced to death for murder.\nHowever, it is revealed that the preceding events are actually a film the two were showing to Steven Spielberg, who pronounces it the greatest movie ever made. Tim and Eric then celebrate with their Awesome Show co-stars."}
