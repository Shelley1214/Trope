{"mid": "Outrage", "IMDB_id": "tt0091709", "title": "Outrage!", "plot": "=== Overview ===\nOutrage argues that several American political figures have led closeted gay lives while supporting and endorsing legislation that is harmful to the gay community. The film examines the mass media's reluctance to discuss issues involving gay politicians despite many comparable news stories about heterosexual politicians and scandals. Outrage describes this behavior as a form of institutionalized homophobia that has resulted in a tacit policy of self-censorship when reporting on these issues. The film is based on the work of blogger Michael Rogers and his site blogactive.com.\n=== Subjects ===\nAmong other subjects, the film includes:\nEd Koch, Democratic Mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989, was a lifelong bachelor, dogged by \"endless gay rumors\", who publicly denied being gay. Although his record on LGBT issues is generally positive, he is blamed for treating the emerging AIDS pandemic in the gay community reluctantly, unlike the health crises he handled in other situations. New York and San Francisco were the main epicenters of AIDS in the early 1980s. Critics, most notably Larry Kramer, believe Koch handled the AIDS crisis poorly because he was closeted. Koch died on February 1, 2013, of congestive heart failure.\nKen Mehlman, the former Republican national chairman, was named in the film as a closeted homosexual though he was against policies friendly to gays.\nLarry Craig, former Republican politician and Senator from Idaho. In 2007, Craig was arrested at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport on suspicion of lewd conduct in a men's restroom, where he was accused of soliciting an undercover police officer for sexual activity."}
