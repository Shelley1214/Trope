Enzo sneaks onto the unit, but is caught by the head nurse and barred from seeing Alfred. As Alfred's condition worsens, Enzo wonders if he is making it worse for the boy. He voices these concerns to a nurse saying, \u201cI\u2019m feeding him lies.\u201d She disagrees and tells Enzo \u201cyou\u2019re giving him hope.\u201d\nAlfred gets worse, and having no access to him, Enzo writes out \u201cthe end of the story\u201d to have the nurse read to him. As the nurse is about to read the ending to a dying Alfred, she changes her mind and, instead, sneaks Enzo onto the unit to tell the rest himself.\nAs he tells the story, the film switches to Alfred\u2019s point of view. With no dialogue, he gets out of bed fully dressed and goes to the window. A giant airship is waiting for him. He walks across an extended ladder from the hospital to the airship. As the airship flies away, hospital windows full of red balloon dogs can be seen."}
