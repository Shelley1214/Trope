{"mid": "OutwardBound", "IMDB_id": "tt0021225", "title": "Outward Bound", "plot": "Henry and Ann (Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Helen Chandler), a pair of young lovers, are planning to commit suicide and are worried about what will happen to their dog when they are gone. The scene then changes to a disparate group of passengers who find themselves aboard a darkened, fog-enshrouded crewless boat, sailing to an unknown destination.\nTheir stories are revealed one by one. Tom Prior (Leslie Howard), a prodigal son, discovers that he's traveling with his ex-boss, Mr. Lingley (Montagu Love), a captain of industry; Tom's mother, Mrs. Midget (Beryl Mercer), whose identity is unknown to him, is curious about how her son is doing; Mrs. Cliveden-Banks (Alison Skipworth), an affected socialite, chats with Scrubby the steward (Alec B. Francis); Rev. William Duke (Lyonel Watts), a clergyman, is keen about his missionary work in the London slums; and the young couple, Henry and Ann, who are facing an impossible love affair and have decided that they cannot live without each other. They now wonder if they will be together forever.\nIn time, the passengers slowly realize what is going on\u2014they are all dead. They will be judged during the course of the voyage and go either to Heaven or to Hell. Arriving at their destination, they await judgment by Thompson, the \"examiner.\"\nHenry and Ann, who made an unsuccessful suicide attempt and now hover in a sort of limbo between life and death, have not quite crossed over. Scrubby, the ship's steward, has already been condemned to sail the ship for eternity, having previously committed suicide himself. Henry is eventually saved from asphyxiation by gas poisoning when his dog breaks a window pane. He calls to Ann, she revives, and together they are rescued by neighbors and taken away in an ambulance."}
