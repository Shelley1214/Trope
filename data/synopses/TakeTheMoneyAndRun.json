{"mid": "TakeTheMoneyAndRun", "IMDB_id": "tt0065063", "title": "Take the Money and Run", "plot": "Virgil Starkwell's (Woody Allen) story is told in documentary style, using both stock footage and interviews with people who knew him. He begins a life of crime at a young age. As a child, Virgil is a frequent target of bullies, who snatch his glasses and stomp on them on the floor. As an adult, Virgil is inept and unlucky, and both police and judges ridicule him by stomping on Virgil's glasses.\nVirgil falls in love with a young lady, Louise (Janet Margolin), a laundry worker, and they live together. They even have a baby.\nVirgil is arrested for trying to rob a bank after handing to a teller a threatening note with the word \"gun\" misspelled. He is sent to prison, but attempts an escape using a bar of soap carved to resemble a gun. Unfortunately for him, it was raining outside and his gun dissolves. He does escape, but by accident. Joining a mass breakout plan, Virgil is the only inmate not warned that the scheme had been called off.\nOutside but unemployed, Virgil finds no way to support himself and his family. Eventually he is rearrested and sent to a chain gang, where he is undernourished (the single meal of the day is a bowl of steam) and brutally punished (consigned to a steam box with an insurance salesman).\nVirgil again escapes but is eventually captured when attempting to rob a former friend who reveals he is now a cop. He is sentenced to 800 years, but remains upbeat knowing that \"with good behavior, I can get that cut in half\". In the last scene, he is shown carving a bar of soap and asking the interviewer if it is raining outside."}
