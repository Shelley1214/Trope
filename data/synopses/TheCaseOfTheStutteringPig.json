{"mid": "TheCaseOfTheStutteringPig", "IMDB_id": "tt0028696", "title": "The Case of the Stuttering Pig", "plot": "On a dark and stormy night, Porky and his brothers (Patrick, Percy, Portis, Peter) and sister (Petunia) learn from lawyer Goodwill that they are set to inherit a fortune from their deceased rich uncle Solomon, with the \"kindly\" lawyer next in line after them. After Goodwill leaves, he walks into a secret laboratory and drinks a bottle of Jekyll and Hyde juice and turns into a hideous monster bent on killing them. The monster breaks the fourth wall and warns the audience not to interfere, with special emphasis by threatening the guy in the third row. One by one, he kidnaps the brothers, leaving only Porky and Petunia. As Porky and Petunia walk through the house, trying to find their brothers, the monster grabs Petunia, unbeknownst to Porky, and then starts trailing Porky. When Porky sees the monster, he screams and runs up the stairs, only to meet the monster at the top. He then screams and runs down the stairs, into the laboratory where the monster is holding his siblings prisoner. No sooner has Porky freed them than the monster breaks in and corners all of the pigs. Just when it seems the monster is going to kill them, a thrown theater chair (seemingly out of nowhere) flies into the monster, trapping him in the stocks where he had them earlier.\nAll six pigs (amazed by the incident): Who did that?!\nOff-stage voice (shouting angrily): ME!\nMonster (shocked at who attacked him): Who are YOU?!\nOff-stage voice (replying angrily): I'm the guy in the third row, ya big sourpuss!!!"}
