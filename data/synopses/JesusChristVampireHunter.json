Maxine Schreck [Murielle Varhelyi]\nand Johnny Golgotha [Ian Driscroll], two important members of Father Eustace's parish are\nmissing, and Eustace [Tim Devries] can no longer sit by and watch, so he calls on the\nhelp of the greatest vampire hunter of all--Jesus Christ [Phil Caracas]. After a shave,\nhaircut, and some new clothes, Jesus sets out to kick vampire ass, aided\nby Mary Magnum [Maria Moulton] in her red jumpsuit.Maxine and Johnny, now vampires, are running a vampire ring. They\nprefer to feed on lesbians (because nobody will miss them), and Dr\nPretorius [Josh Grace] grafts lesbian skin to the bodies of vampires, allowing them to\nwalk during the day. When Mary falls prey to the vampires, God sends the\nmasked wrestler, Santo Enmascarado de Plata [Jeff Moffet], to help Jesus. Together, they\nkick and stake several dozen vampires and get kicked and staked a bit\nthemselves. When Mary, John, and Maxine attempt to quarter Jesus, Santo\nbites the ropes that bind him. Fr Eustace, also a vampire now, stakes\nJesus through the heart. But this serves only to let his heartlight shine\non the vampires, reducing them all to dust. Fortunately, Jesus is able to heal Mary Magnum, who requests that he also heal Maxine so that they can be together. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"}
