{"mid": "SteamboatWillie", "IMDB_id": "tt0019422", "title": "Steamboat Willie", "plot": "Mickey Mouse pilots a river steamboat, suggesting that he himself is the captain. He cheerfully whistles \"Steamboat Bill\" and sounds the boat's three whistles. Soon the real captain, Pete, appears and orders Mickey off the bridge. Mickey blows a raspberry at Pete, and then Pete attempts to kick him but Mickey rushes away in time and Pete kicks himself in the rear accidentally. Mickey rushes down the stairs, slips on a bar of soap on the boat's deck and lands in a bucket of water. A parrot laughs at him, and Mickey throws the bucket at it.\nPete, who has been watching the whole thing, pilots the steamboat himself. He bites off some chewing tobacco and spits into the wind. The spit flies backward and rings the boat's bell. Amused by this Pete spits again, but it hits himself in the face, making him fuss.\nThe steamboat makes a stop at \"Podunk Landing\" to pick up a cargo of various livestock. Just as they set off again, Minnie appears, running to catch the boat before it leaves. Mickey does not see her in time, but she runs after the boat along the shore and Mickey takes her on board by hooking the cargo crane to her underwear.\nLanding on deck, Minnie accidentally drops a guitar and some sheet music for the song \"Turkey in the Straw\" which are eaten by a goat. The two mice use the goat's body as a phonograph which they play by turning its tail like a crank. Mickey uses various objects on the boat as percussion accompaniment and \"plays\" the animals like musical instruments. This ends with them using a cow's teeth to play the song as a xylophone.\nFinally Captain Pete is unamused and puts Mickey to work peeling potatoes. In the potato bin, another parrot appears in the port hole and laughs at him again. The mouse throws a peeled potato at him, knocking him into the river below. The film ends with Mickey laughing."}
