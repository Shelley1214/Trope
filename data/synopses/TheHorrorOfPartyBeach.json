{"mid": "TheHorrorOfPartyBeach", "IMDB_id": "tt0058208", "title": "The Horror of Party Beach", "plot": "At a small East Coast beach town, a boat dumps radioactive toxic waste into the ocean, which lands on a sunken ship and the skeletons of shipwrecked dead sailors. The skeletons and water plants are mutated by the waste, transforming into half-human, half-fish monsters that make their way to the surface.\nHank Green, an employee of scientist Dr. Gavin, attends a beach party with his immature girlfriend, Tina. Tina is drinking alcohol, and, when Hank disapproves, they argue. The party catches the attention of a motorcycle gang. Tina flirts with the leader, Mike, while Hank talks with Dr. Gavin's young-adult daughter Elaine. When Hank tries to take Tina away, Mike fights him. Hank wins, and Tina apologizes to Hank, but he leaves. Mike is taken home by his gang. Tina swims to some rocks far away from the beach, where one of the monsters kills her. The sight of her body causes commotion on the beach.\nAfter Tina's death, Elaine worries about Hank but is reassured by her father. Eulabelle, Dr. Gavin's housekeeper, suggests that some kind of voodoo is responsible for Tina's death. Gavin refuses to believe this. Later that night, Elaine cancels going to a slumber party with her friends. The monsters, whose numbers have increased, attack the slumber party and kill most of the girls. This news spreads quickly.\nThree female travelers drive through the town on their way to New York. Their car's tire goes flat near Fingel's Quarry. While attempting to fix the tire, they are killed by the monsters. One of the monsters, stalking two girls in town, is enraged when they are picked up before it can kill them. The monster, noticing a clothing store with female mannequins on display, breaks the window with a punch, ripping off its arm. Dr. Gavin and Hank study the severed arm, which is still alive, and they cannot figure out how to kill it. Eulabelle accidentally spills a container of metallic sodium on the arm, which kills it, giving the scientists a way of destroying the monsters.\nDr. Gavin and Hank search for the monsters. After discovering that the monsters can be tracked by their trail of radioactive water, Hank drives to New York City to obtain sodium. Dr. Gavin initially has no luck in finding the monsters. Eulabelle tells him that Elaine went to look for the monsters at Fingel's Quarry. Dr. Gavin rushes off to help Elaine, bringing a small case of sodium with him. Elaine tests the water for radioactivity, and the monsters chase her. She trips between two rocks and injures her leg. Dr. Gavin arrives and throws sodium at the monster attacking Elaine, killing it. Another monster attacks, but Dr. Gavin is out of sodium and must defend his daughter himself. Hank, who is bringing more sodium, is stopped by a police officer, who leads him to Fingel's Quarry. Hank saves Dr. Gavin by killing the monster attacking him, and the group kills the remaining monsters.\nHank visits Elaine, who is recovering from her leg injury."}
