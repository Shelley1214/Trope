As he arrives on his first day, he meets fellow teacher Terry Corrigan (Roddy McDowall) who is carrying a gun. When Norris asks about the firearm, Corrigan assures the new teacher that he will soon know why such protection is necessary. When they enter the school, Norris is shocked to see everyone scanned by metal detectors and frisked. He spots a student with a knife, but the security guards let the kid go because they are so overworked.\nThe halls of the school are covered with graffiti. Norris learns that he is expected to patrol the halls as a security guard during his off periods. In his first class, a group of disruptive kids who are not registered in band are roughhousing and causing trouble. The leader of the gang is Peter Stegman (Timothy Van Patten). They quiet down enough to let Norris try to run the class where some kids genuinely want to learn, like Arthur (Michael J. Fox) who plays trumpet and Deneen who plays clarinet.\nAs Norris gets to know the school and the area, he decides that he wants to put together an orchestra with his more advanced students. The film follows Stegman's gang as they sell drugs, run a strip club, and cause all kinds of mayhem. They follow Norris home and taunt him one night.\nAt school, Norris is confronted with more and more evidence of Stegman's crimes. The two grow increasingly at odds. Eventually, they wind up in a bathroom alone together. Stegman throws himself into a mirror and beats himself up before claiming that Norris attacked him. Trying to clear things up, Norris visits Stegman's mother at home. Frustrated when Stegman still plays the victim and his mother will not hear Norris out, he hotwires Stegman's car and drives it into a wall.\nThe film climaxes as Norris' orchestra is about to give its first concert. As his wife gets ready at home, Stegman's gang breaks into the house and gang rapes her. One of them takes a Polaroid of her being raped and has it delivered to Norris on the podium, just as he is about to start the concert. Horrified by the photo, Norris runs off the podium in pursuit of Stegman's gang. The remainder of the film depicts Norris and the gang chasing each other through the school. Norris kills them off one by one, and he finally confronts Stegman on the roof. Their last scuffle ends with Stegman falling through a skylight and getting tangled in the ropes above the stage. He falls into full view of the audience as his neck is broken by one of the ropes.\nThe film ends with a title that claims Norris was never charged because the police could not find a witness to the crime."}
