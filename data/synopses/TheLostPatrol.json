{"mid": "TheLostPatrol", "IMDB_id": "tt0025423", "title": "The Lost Patrol", "plot": "During World War I, the commanding officer of a small British patrol in the Mesopotamian desert is shot and killed by an unseen Arab sniper, leaving the Sergeant at a loss, since he had not been told what their mission is. He decides to try to rejoin the brigade, though he does not know where they are or where he is.\nEventually, the 11 men in his unit reach an oasis. During the night, one of the sentries is killed, the other seriously wounded, and all their horses are stolen, leaving them stranded. One by one, the remaining men are picked off by the unseen enemy. In desperation, the Sergeant sends two men chosen by lot on foot for help, but they are caught and tortured to death, before their bodies are sent back. Abelson, suffering from heat exhaustion, sees a mirage and wanders into deadly fire. The pilot of a British biplane spots the survivors, but nonchalantly lands nearby and is killed before he can be warned. The men take the machine gun from the aircraft then set the plane on fire in a desperate bid to signal British troops. Sanders, a religious fanatic, goes mad and walks into deadly fire.\nIn the end, only the Sergeant is left. When the six Arab soldiers finally show themselves, he manages to kill them all with the machine gun from the aircraft. Moments later, another British patrol arrives, attracted by the smoke from the burning aircraft."}
