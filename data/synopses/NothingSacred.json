{"mid": "NothingSacred", "IMDB_id": "tt0029322", "title": "Nothing Sacred", "plot": "New York newspaper reporter Wally Cook (Fredric March) is blamed for passing off Harlem bootblack Ernest Walker (Troy Brown) as an African nobleman hosting a charity event (despite his claims of not knowing this was false). Cook is demoted to writing obituaries. He begs his boss Oliver Stone (Walter Connolly) for another chance. Wally is sent to the (fictional) town of Warsaw, Vermont, to interview Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard), a woman supposedly dying of radium poisoning. Cook finally locates Hazel, who is crying because her doctor has told her that she is not dying. Unaware of this, he invites her to New York as the guest of the Morning Star newspaper.\nThe newspaper uses her story to increase its circulation. She receives a ticker tape parade and the key to the city, and becomes an inspiration to many. In addition, she and Wally fall in love. When it is finally discovered that Hazel is not really dying, city officials decide that it would be better to avoid embarrassment by having it seem that she committed suicide. Hazel and Wally get married and quietly set sail for the tropics."}
