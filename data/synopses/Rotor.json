{"mid": "Rotor", "IMDB_id": "tt0098156", "title": "R.O.T.O.R.", "plot": "A leading scientist in the field of police robotics, Dr. J. Barrett C. Coldyron (Gesswein with voice over by Loren Bivens), whose corrupt boss, Division Commander Earl Buglar (Michael Hunter), orders an experimental police robot prototype - dubbed R.O.T.O.R. (Robotic Officer of the Tactical Operations Research/Reserve Unit). He wants it completed in 60 days so that Senator Donald D. Douglas can take public credit for the project and use it to catapult himself into the White House.\nColdyron warns Buglar that the prototype is several years away from completion but is forced to resign and is replaced by his incompetent assistants, Dr. Houghtaling (Stan Moore) and his robot Willard. In Coldyron's absence, R.O.T.O.R. is inadvertently activated and put on duty. The robot executes a motorist (James Cole) for speeding and terrorizes his young fianc\u00e9e, Sonya (Margaret Trigg), who the robot views as an accomplice in her boyfriend's infraction. Upon learning his creation has escaped, Cpt. Coldyron enlists the help of his beautiful colleague, Dr. Corrine Steele (Jayne Smith), who designed the unit's combat chassis. Together, Steele and Coldyron track down the rampaging robot and attempt to stop it from killing again."}
